73, Apollon said — they are involved with the gangs themselves. His organization has interviewed young people with heavy weaponry that is not easy to acquire, because they, too, have not publicly addressed these accusations.,,,
74, nearly every government official or institution has avoided taking responsibility.,,,,,,
75, the police chief simply said it was planned by the local captain and the new U.N. mission. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant told the press that the specifics of field operations were outside his purview. Both blamed poor planning for the bloodshed.,,,,,,

98, it is quite obvious that there were definite reasons why Zambia was targeted to host the meeting. The Southern African state is one of the few countries within the AU which has a military attache stationed in Israel where it opened an embassy in 2015. Israel does not have an embassy in Zambia.,,,,,,

106, its leaders specifically sought to align themselves with the rising tide of colonialism throughout Asia and Africa. During the early phase of the Zionist movement Palestine was not the only location examined for the establishment of a Jewish state.

114, as a result of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, there has been a period of thawing relations between Tel Aviv and some African states.,,,,,
115, African solidarity with Palestine remains strong. The Republic of South Africa under the ruling African National Congress (ANC) continues to be a bulwark of sentiment in favor of the recognition of an independent Palestinian state. This mood has existed in Zimbabwe as well during the 37-year presidency of Robert Mugabe,,,,,,
116,,,,,,,
117, the ANC,,,,,,
118, due to military and political considerations ranks as the second largest recipient of direct aid from Washington. However,,,,,,
119, the holding of an Israel-Africa Summit in Zambia would represent a tremendous setback in the progressive legacy of independent states on the continent. At this critical stage in international relations AU member countries should be intensifying their cooperation with other fraternal governments and peoples on the continent and indeed throughout the world.,,,,,,

Even in that time we have had, for example, many are finding themselves in precarious work, in a system called E-tolls that commercializes the use of the roads.,,
595, and ultimately Marikana,,,,,,
596, it was not a government that was interested in social justice for the majority of the working class; it was a government which had in essence become a security guard if I can say to protect white corporate and white capitalist interests. I think it’s very important, we are just articulating the reality. In a country where the majority of the people are African, it just doesn’t make sense that the economy should be controlled by such a small percentage of people. That is ultimately what we are fighting against. Thats why in 2013, and we were now going to pursue an agenda for the working class and we were going to pursue the idea of the formation of a worker’s party,,,
597, however,,,,,,
598, we were then expelled from COSATU, and you will hear they use the right kind of language, because they do have that liberation history, in practice if you look at the economic policies that have been implemented,,,
599, African workers had no right to organize, and you could be severely punished for being involved in those types of activities. Now what we are finding is that they are trying to change the legislation, but its a type of oppression that is very clever. They are not oppressing you with the gun, the state has the right to approach the labor court, if its having “an extremely negative impact on the economy”.,,
600, and hold elections among ourselves where we allow our members to vote and say whether they want to have a strike or not. Usually in trade union culture when members want to go on strike its very simple. You have a mass meeting, we want to go on strike” or “No that’s it, we are done, it is now being hampered by bureaucracy. So they are using bureaucracy as a way to limit our right to strike.,,,
601, it is now being hampered by bureaucracy.”,,,,,,
602, they believe that the violence that took place at that time was because the workers were violent. The workers were violent, it was one of the longest strikes ever recorded in post-apartheid South Africa. It almost destroyed the platinum industry in South Africa because workers were inspired by what they had seen in Marikana and they were also horrified by the mass murder, so they refused to back down on the demand for 12, which the state couldn’t break.,,,
603, which they designed to try and limit our rights so that they can actually intervene and stop the strike when they feel like we are having too much of an impact. At NUMSA that means we are even more an enemy of the state than we were before, but we are also planning to take the issue to the Constitutional Court. We believe that it is a constitutional violation, that what our government is trying to achieve is actually going to remove our most basic rights,,,,
604,,,,,,,
605, solidarity -- whether it’s Pan African or international -- is critical. We were part of the liberation movement in the days of apartheid and it was international solidarity that played a major role in destroying the apartheid government. As Marxists and as Leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent.,,,,,,
606, particularly because as South Africans we were hosted by the Zambian government under apartheid and now that we see them, they are very good friends. The mainstream media in South Africa is asleep when it comes to these issues. They are not very connected to what is going on in the continent, they are very focused on what is goes on in South Africa,,,,
607,,,,,,,
608, and even my presence here in Brazil as a representative of NUMSA is part of that process. We believe that it is very important that we must build these relationships because we can see the attack against the working class, and we are all suffering from that. When you look at what happens in that transition, what kind of government takes place after that so called liberation takes place,,,,
609, that oppression has resulted in an unemployment rate of 35% and growing, so we realized that it is not enough for you to fight a battle against racism, ultimately the demon here is not racism,,,,

646, I didn’t feel the Catholic Church was on the side of the people. If they were,,,,,,
647, let’s step back and explain that. Kabila’s term was to have expired in December 2016,,,,,,
648, but the Catholic Church didn’t agree.,,,,,,
649, right?,,,,,,
650, to be honest, but the objective of that march was unclear. The Church should have taken a clear stance and refused to accept anything but Kabila’s departure from power. No more compromise should have been made after he once again failed to organize elections. The objective of the march was to pressure Kabila to implement the December 31st [31,] 2016 agreement,,,,
651, the president’s republican guard,,,,,,
652,,,,,,,
653, the Church isn’t even close to refusing to recognize Kabila’s legitimacy. So it’s leaving the political balance of power untouched and Kabila is happy with this outcome.,,,,,,
654,,,,,,,
655, there are other forms of nonviolent protests that are not being implemented by the opposition or the Church.,,,,,,
656, at this point, all the NATO powers, and China are happy with the chaos and the mayhem. They’re not disturbed enough to do anything about it. Russia doesn’t seem to be very involved. And the UN Security Council has never been willing to acknowledge Rwanda or Uganda’s presence in the Congo,,,,
657, that’s an accurate description of the situation as I see it. The Congolese people are alone in their struggle against Kabila. Russia, support Kabila because they do have ongoing deals. There is an unspoken consensus of the powerful players for leaving the situation on the ground as it is. It’s unfortunate but that’s the sad fact.,,,,,
658, and the Congolese people continue to be murdered and massacred without any real intervention on their behalf. MONUSCO, most of which is paid by the West. On December 7, well-armed troops wearing Congolese uniforms actually attacked Tanzanian peacekeepers who were taking their mission seriously—trying to protect the population and stop the aggressors in Béni Territory—in a clear warning that real peacekeepers would not be tolerated.,,,,
659, knee-jerk calls for justice and democracy in response to these crimes and nothing is done. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Halley went to see Kabila and told him he’s obliged to organize elections in December 2018—same time next year.,,,,,,
660, I looked back at the moment in Congo’s history when King Leopold’s enforcers were committing unspeakable atrocities to extract rubber and whatever other resources from the “Congo Free State, but there was so much outrage about King Leopold’s brutality that the international community of the time finally reacted. Is anything like that conceivable now?,,,,,
661, Kabila has been given an assignment. International interests have decided to outsource Congolese resource extraction to him, fulfilling their de facto mandate. Never mind what they say out loud in the UN Security Council, on UN Web TV,,,,
662, basically, but Kabila’s just an apparatchik.,,,,,

839, the physically imposing Wolverines were able to overcome this brutal defeat by winning their other two games last week against both Maryland and Rutgers.

1889, we can see that the Anakim peoples were descended from someone called Anak,,,,,,
1890, it might seem as though the Palestinian people today inhabited the land of Israel before the Jews did,,,,,,
1891, let us dig a bit deeper shall we.,,,,,,
1892, let’s see what the Bible has to say!,,,,,,
1893, the sons of Anak,,,,,,
1894, led by God invaded the Canaanite territories and eventually settled in and around Jerusalem. Generations later,,,,,,
1895, these weren’t just your average tall person that we commonly see in society today,,,,,,

1899, behold, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh,,,,
1900, thou, and thy sons’ wives with thee.,,,,,
1901, whereby the sons of God (fallen angels that followed Lucifer’s rebellion in the pre-Adamite days) introduced themselves to humanity, but because they had advanced technology, they introduced genetic manipulation into the the flora and fauna on the earth; mixing DNA with just about every living carbon-based organism. This was done to corrupt humanity,,,,
1902, that’s right! Aliens are real. They are specifically mentioned in the Bible, the Devil, Lucifer,,,,
1903,,,,,,,
1904, but somehow some of them survived and managed to slowly repopulate the earth. Their next attempt to thwart God’s plan for humanity was to construct a tower in Babel, Buddhism and all other eastern religions, Islamic traditions, prostitution, rituals, capitalism, child/blood sacrifices and a host of other idolatrous practices that serve humanity no purpose except to deter it from evolving into what it was created to be…

1906, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him,,,,
1907, both man and woman, and sheep, and ass,,,,
1908, and had to be eliminated at all costs. Call it the first alien virus that could wipe out humanity….slowly and surely! Human babies might be cute, synagogues, temples and schools will not teach you, strife and all other human woes that we can never seem to totally get rid of.,,,
1909, we need to stop hiding from the truth, for this will impact the rest of the world, whether it is ready or not. The Americans have disclosed their proofs of encounters with aliens, but originated a long time ago by a prideful angelic being named Lucifer that thought he knew God’s plan better than God himself!,,,

2881,,,,,,,
2882,,,,,,,
2883, saved by ant people. The ant people took our ancestors underground and taught us how to survive,,,,,,
2884, but comparatively and allegorically speaking the Hopi creation story approaches perfection in its eloquence. Ants are the only animal in the world that humanity can be accurately compared with so much so that perhaps mankind was influenced by ants more than any other being. Humans and ants are farmers, thieves and enslavers alike. No other animal behaves like man, except ants,,,,
2885, from whatever nationalistic, but amassing invasion forces to take over as much of South America as antly possible. Any other ant colony they encounter, they destroy. They vanquish all other antkind and if ants believe anything at all,,,,
2886, Japan, the Argentine Ants recognize and accept each other no matter what continental colony they are from, and destroy all other ants they encounter.,,,,
2887, that extend into the millions, tactical warfare. It’s a nature of battle only possible among communities with plenty of excess labor force.” ~Mark Moffet,,,,,
2888, not their instincts or biological needs. Few other species on the planet operate in this manner. The colony might be hundreds,,,,,,
2889,,,,,,,
2890, only mammalian with opposable thumbs. People are the aboveground version of ants with internal skeletons instead of external ones,,,,,,
2891, but the colony at large has a rich history of millions of years and the collective acts with the impetus of such an age old regime. They are biologically reinforced matriarchies with a history that makes the rise of humanity just another pulse of different beings to eat off,,,,,,
2892, they harvest from their surroundings, out of concern for war and others stealing from us. Ants build anthills and then build massive tunnels based on defense of the queen if enemy ants were to invade. Mankind builds in the same manner, as a means of protection.,,,,
2893, look kindly upon the whole human family and take away the arrogance and hatred which separate us from our brothers.” ~Cherokee Prayer,,,,,,
2894, as collectives, enslave and behave. Perhaps the original pyramids and pyramid builders saw their structures as having antkind qualities, built in symbolic homage to the antkind structure and mindset,,,,
2895,,,,,,,
2896, in a collective state. And yet we are individuals,,,,,,
2897, because all preparations have been made, despite the fact they are all ants. Humans when placed in bordered blocks suffer the same end, war based on differences despite our sameness. It is arguable that the predominant measure of distinction between people is differences in perception. It is easy to say that we are as beasts and therefore bound to behave as ants and yet we are much more.,,,,
2898, like the areas in France and elsewhere major fighting in WWI and WWII took place. A more intense example of the ant like nature of humanized borders is demonstrated throughout The Middle East. Multiple doctrines, heritage distinctions and cultural fluctuations to form borders of all sorts. And war of all sorts. It is easy to say war is inevitable for antkind and mankind both. It is easy to be unconscious and gnash with the collective, but humanity is capable of much more. In fact,,,,
2899, but the result is the same -states with proud histories or colonies with biological impulses and the outsiders they clash with along the borders.,,,,,,
2900, and we are all spurred by the same godly forces that created ants. So perhaps it is not so difficult to understand which ant is best. It is whichever ant is able to develop and evolve, they have not done much by the way of. It is perhaps an impulse from beyond the beyond to not only be tribal and build walls, but to war on each other. It must be an impulse for ants do not have minds as man does. No matter if one is a tiny robotic entity of an underground ant mound or an aware human,,,,
2901, most made toward and during war. However man is complex mainly due to our consciousness. Instead of antennae we have phones. Instead of claws and teeth we have knives, we enslave each other the same, humans may have very well thought of agriculture in the first place by watching ants and building pyramids in the middle of our cities by watching ant colonies. Perhaps the Hopi were more correct than we could ever know. Perhaps long ago man was adopted by ants,,,,
2902, or more. Today many ants still farm or tend to fungus grown in their lairs for the colony to eat, bad and ugly ideas.,,,,,
2903, the bigger ants takeover the smaller ants naturally. Or like the Argentine ants instead of enslaving they annihilate. Humanity’s enslavement of weaker people is comparable to bigger ants meeting smaller ants. Violence and war however perverse is rooted in biological aspects proven by antkind and yet mankind discusses war as tradition, or politics. People present reasoning for killing each other en masse, but it’s a biological response we are able to surpass. Or rather we can surpass when we think as individuals,,,,
2904, mainly because no other animals are as culturally developed with such refined caste systems and no other species kill each other on a massive organized scale. No other species wars. Mankind is more efficient at construction and destruction, we voyage to harvest and conquer and practices the same behavior as antkind comparable to them in our simplicity.,,,,,
2905, farming, initiating all other similarities. Perhaps the fact that we build walls and forts and prepare for war leads to the tendency to war and plunder those outside the walls in the first place. Perhaps the wall builders alone spurred the necessity to find tools as more efficient means of warring or plundering resources or building better forts. Ants and humans build complex dwellings in part as a way to defend the collective, which appears righteous,,,,
2906, Nehemiah and long before.,,,,,,
2907, after all they can be seen from space. Teachers teach that walls are great. Walls are perimeters,,,,,,
2908, and when there is no wall people tend to leave,,,,,,
2909,,,,,,,
2910, the quantity of melanin you were born with or without, is being proud of having done something on your own. This false pride in walls built thousands of years ago is the same. Forget about the ancient walls and do something new with your own hands. Walls have been getting in the way of the development of our collective mentality for millennia. Walls make us more like ants than farming or harvesting or raising livestock ever could. Walls build up the infrastructure that maintains war and the border mind state of war.,,,,,
2911, our lacking consciousness.,,,,,,
2912,,,,,,,
2913, leaving us stuck – with ourselves. The bordermind is initiated and we live encased in spiritual and mental walls we built around ourselves through institutionalization. We are walled in by experiences by layers of ego armor and a culture of separation in post-modern society. We close ourselves in from reality in ways we shouldn’t and try to in ways we couldn’t.,,,,,,
2914, whether Einstein or an American Indian elder, is also eternally valuable. And so is ceasing cooperation with systems/institutions which on questioning, prove to be wrongful and based on lies. Stopping wrong is an eternally applicable and valuable act. Stopping to think leads to art and cultural development. Proactive focused inactivity spurs societal change and consciousness development of the individual,,,,

3168, Black Agenda Report's commitment to the Black Radical Tradition was an inspiration in a period marked by deep political reaction. Black Agenda Report did not betray its political principles in the face of the first Black President at a time when there was immense pressure to do so. Black Agenda Report not only provided a forum for Black left political thought and action,,,,,,
3169, Eight Years in Power capitalized on the rise of Donald Trump in the aftermath of the Obama era. Coates has benefitted from the neo-liberal brand of Black leadership that grew in strength during the era of Obama.

3172, there were many who quickly sought to distance themselves from the substance of West’s position. West was channeling W.E.B.

3177, we should be taking the time to learn from it. Internationalism has been a fundamental aspect of the Black Radical Tradition from the very outset of its development. Whether Coates has or hasn't addressed the questions of War and Wall Street throughout his illustrious career is not of primary concern. The concern is that his body of work is less reflective of the Black Radical Tradition and more so the perils of collaboration with imperialism. West questions Coates' commitment to the Black Radical Tradition by citing both a record of inaction on the questions of Wall Street and war and a tendency to align with the Obama wing of imperialism toward profitable ends.,,,,,,

3878, these and other observatories are not only expected to find many more exoplanets, using the Transit Method, to study surface elevations on exoplanets.,,,,
3879, which recently appeared online under the title “Finding Mountains with Molehills: The Detectability of Exotopography“, the team considered whether transit surveys might be able to reveal topographical data on exoplanets.,,,,,
3880,,,,,,,
3881, the Transit Method (aka. Transit Photometry) is currently the most popular and reliable means for detecting exoplanets. It consists of astronomers measuring the light curve of distant stars over time and looking for periodic dips in brightness. These dips are the result of exoplanets passing in front of the star (i.e. transiting) relative to the observer.,,,,,,
3882, and the period with which the dimming occurs, this same method could also reveal the presence of geographical features – for instance, mountain ranges,,,,
3883, in lieu of direct imaging, microlensing, astrometry,,,,
3884, under the assumption that the planet is not luminous itself… This fact implies that there is indeed some potential for transits to reveal surface features,,,,,,

3888, which is all that is necessary to see all of the planet’s features appear on its silhouette without repeating. As our hypothetical planet rotates and the Himalayan block moves into and out of view,,,,,,
3889, they consider that Mars would be the ideal test case due to its combination of small size, which has caused it become what they describe as the “bumpiest body in the Solar System”. When paired with a white dwarf star, this presents the optimal case for using light curves to determine exotopography.,,,,
3890, Olympus Mons,,,,,,
3891, they calculate that a Mars-sized planet would have an orbital period of 11.3 hours. This would allow for many transits to be observed in a relatively short viewing period,,,,,,
3892, due to the presence of astrophysical and instrumental noise, the method could produce some highly valuable scientific returns.,,,,,
3893, it would present some rather fascinating opportunities to learn more about planets beyond our Solar System. As they explain:,,,,,,
3894, but we can also infer planet characteristics from the presence and distribution of surface features. For example,,,,,,
3895, planets with a high degree of bumpiness would indicate tectonic activity or the buildup of lava caused by internal heating sources. Those with the highest bumpiness (i.e. like Mars) would indicate that they too experience a combination internal processes, and a lack of tectonic plate movement. Meanwhile, low-bumpiness planets are less likely to have any of these internal processes and their surfaces are more likely to be shaped by external factors – like asteroid bombardment.,,,,

4235, which trivialized the millennia long rule of the global military industrial complex, religious cults, aristocracies,,,,
4236, the human fluke and its parasitic behavior modification of mankind. The human fluke has been our constant companion, hosts acting out parasitic impulses. Mankind’s subjection to parasitic behavior modification has shaped the world.,,,,,
4237, resulting in one of two extremes of modified behavior. The slightly more common type is the bacterial dependent fluke, like sheep. The fungal infections result in scheming, aggressive behavior,,,,
4238, like everything in nature, and more complexly, they relate to each other through modifying the behavior of the host. The parasitically guided interaction between people made sheepish or coyote-like is traditionally viewed as some sort of right wing/left wing political constant,,,,
4239, or cysts,,,,,,
4240, passive and bullied, those who seek to control in order to survive, are host to fungal dependent flukes. The flukes,,,,

Massive amounts of almonds and apricots eaten will eventually kill the flukes. In stomach acid the combination produces therapeutic cyanide which kills parasites. Certain extracts of wormwood, modes of delivery and time periods required for effectiveness. Practicing yoga or tai chi hasten the results of these holistic cures, but even still the apricots and almonds cure requires up to three months of eating as many almonds and apricots as you can along with vegan diet.,,,,
4243, works quickly and is inexpensive, because it kills flukes. And those in the know who use and foster the parasitic predicament for their own parasitic gains made it so. Adding to the complexity of the dis-symbiotic relationship of the fluke and man are the occult who know and manipulate the infected. They have tried to restrict knowledge of all curatives and access to the most reasonable one; marijuana. The global drug war began with the prohibition of marijuana and hemp. Most realize this was to protect business interests, make the rich richer and in turn keep poor people poor,,,,
4244, why they think the way they do and yet frequently, however complicated, is just vocalization of fungal or bacterial impulses controlling them. Scientists are well aware of parasitic behavior modification in the animal world,,,,
4245, toxoplasma gondii is the most researched and understood. Toxoplasma gondii depends on felines to reproduce and uses rats to gain access to cats in this mortal dis-symbiosis. It supposedly doesn’t harm cats, logical reasons for making an introduction to the cat, that if it were capable of explaining it would,,,,
4246, but it’s the worm’s plan, that they are deciding to ascend to the top of the stalk, but it is only so the parasite can have a nice place to spore out from within the ant.,,,,
4247, but the real reason people act dominant or submissive is totally biological, the cat and toxoplasma gondii.,,,,,
4248, it’s theorized, so the host kills itself, so it can get out of the dead thing and hopefully into a cat. In the case of the rat their primal fear is the scent of feline urine, sheep, like toxoplasma gondii and the fungal dependent human flukes,,
4249, only unlike toxoplasma gondii they remain within their hosts indefinitely, this dis-symbiosis of man, comes together in a way more intricate than perhaps any other similar system on the planet, and finally the occult groups,,,

4253, but primarily is due to saturation of radioactive particulate. The wave emitting particulate is at the root of atmospheric destruction,,,,,,

4255, the military industrial complex instituted the secret program to counteract the degradation.,,,,,,
4256, beginning with the radioactive atmospheric degradation. The degradation of the atmosphere is just one threat brought on by nuclear experimentation. Thermonuclear war of course is another. But the real story of nuclear experimentation, has never been revealed publicly, until now.,,,,
4257, the U.S.A. gathered together some of the wildest scientific minds in history and eventually set off the first nuclear detonation in New Mexico, Japan. World war was won and world history was forever altered. The experiment was so dangerous, the forces so outrageous that the scientists debated on whether or not the first detonation would set off a chain reaction igniting the atmosphere,,,,
4258,,,,,,,

4260, having gone from one city to escape the other. Around 70, for most people were disappeared, atomized. Many more hundreds of thousands died from burns,,,,
4261, there was a box set next to the Trinity detonation which supposedly contained a living being of some sort for a top secret experiment. Some say there was a demon inside it. Others say the explosion itself released the demon. The official story states the box contained sensitive testing equipment. There is no denying the demon that is nuclear, omissions, whispers,,,,
4262, 16, on the ground, underground and in the ocean. Each one of the detonations started chain reactions of entropy we are only beginning to understand. Now hundreds of nuclear experiment reactors around the world boil water for electricity, just one is capable of altering or destroying entirety.

4271, chief among being the destruction of the very ethereal essence. They informed the earthen leadership that the myth of Pandora’s Box is about nuclear experimentation. And that nuclear experimentation would result in Federation ostracism,,,,,,
4272, they knew our languages and cultures and mythology. They knew the whole human story,,,,,,
4273, 1952, number in the thousands. President Harry Truman himself addressed and denied the public questioning concerning extraterrestrials landing on the White house lawn.,,,,,
4274, which was much like our history on Earth, solely because we didn’t want a specific race to have the mineral. The newly formed Federation debated on the extermination of mankind for starting the war, but instead they genetically altered our mental capacity and banished humans to remote prison planets. The reason people only use seven percent of our brain capacity is because of the genetically implemented mental deformity. Supposedly when humans first arrived to prison Earth people quarried stones and erected structures with simplistic devices powered by electromagnetics and the mind.,,,,
4275, only a very few,,,,,,
4276, but the disruption of the space time continuum and electro-magnetosphere caused by nuclear experimentation is what prevents access to the unlimited energy through the otherwise smooth space-time continuum. Nuclear experimentation disrupts the space-time continuum in a way that makes the counter-wave inaccessible. Free energy is near impossible to access due to the present electromagnetic conditions.,,,,,,
4277, but only we have conducted nuclear experimentation. In fact, human humor is universally renowned. Even today, despite our deformity,,,,
4278, in true manly fashion, the very act that made the U.S.A. the world’s super power. The Federation insisted they cease nuclear experimentation and make peace on Earth. In exchange they would offer membership into the Federation. Harry Truman took this to be a sly plot and after winning World War II no one in the universe was going to tell the United States to disarm. Harry Truman didn’t believe them, not after what happened in Roswell and elsewhere.,,,,

4284, not including free energy or interplanetary travel technology,,,,,,
4285, because they want to destroy us. They wanted our genes, the Greys can have Earth. And the quickest way to eliminate our genetic viability is through nuclear experimentation.,,,,,
4286, believing we were tapping into the power of the sun. The Greys just wait for nuclear experimentation to eliminate our biological viability, whereupon they would no longer be responsible and the Greys could takeover.,,,,,
4287, a way to kill us. The madness of nuclear experimentation has exposed us to a mad, so we kill ourselves and the Federation leaves Earth to them.,,,,,

4291, but even the Federation can’t cease the ongoing reactions at nuclear power generation experiments. The Federation legal conundrum has resulted in a waiting game. The Federation considered freeing us from our genetically implemented binds, we too, were so liked by god,,,,
4292, we could have been a human voice,,,,,,
4293, the nuclear experimentation industry has been almost totally compromised by the hybrids, for eventually it will fail and they will win Earth.,,,,,

4295, producing such persistent toxins as to be cancerous forever and make future generations less intelligent, like Krypton 85 result in dramatic drought. Radioactive particles emit heat for thousands of years and are now dispersed globally in all strata reducing the atmosphere’s ability to release heat, increasing holes in the ozone and the new norm of powerful storms.,,,,

The HMO is expected to careen through the solar system and when it does the object may cause the oceans to rise variously by twenty feet or more, savage nuclear industrial death is possible. Even if the HMO only causes sporadic flooding and earthquakes failure of nuclear experimentation is practically guaranteed. Stop nuclear experimentation or we will stop it. Stop all nuclear experimentation or it will stop us all.,,,,,

4649, the bulls finally lost the rising green trendline of support. But the sideways action from the 22nd this week has only formed a tight trading range from the high to the low yesterday. Today’s challenge is for the bulls to make yet another higher high on the backside of that rising green trendline. And from the looks of the MACD’s they will have an excellent chance at doing so. The move down yesterday did weaken the bulls a little but overall it’s still a bullish market. It’s looking more and more like the next “possible” turn period will be around the FOMC meeting next week. But while in the old days we would see it have a bullish close about 80% of the time that day, and therefore no big reaction in the market.,,,,,
4650, for today it looks bullish to me but it’s still very overbought on many time frames. It’s hard to chase a market so overbought and every time you see a pullback you think it’s finally going to rollover and do at least an ABC move down, which should add support for this 60 minute MACD pointing up this morning. Odds are good for a new all time high again today so I’d be shocked if it didn’t happen. I don’t have any more to say as again it looks bullish right now. Anything can change by the close, so if it peaks out and rolls over I’d look for that 2840 area now as support and the new yellow rising trendline I just drew.,,,,

4796, 2018,,,,,,
4797," I was disappointed with President Trump's decision last week to extend the controversial July 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran (the JCPOA) by waiving sanctions and giving Congress and European states a final chance to """"fix"""" this agreement in 120 days. This decision was especially disappointing given the recent Iranian protests and that the president issued a similar ultimatum in October 2016.",,,,,,
4798, there appear to be some undisclosed reasons for this decision that give me hope the president will kill this terrible agreement in the near future.,,,,,,
4799,,,,,,,
4800,,,,,,,
4801, Secretary of State John Kerry and other Obama-administration officials made any concession necessary to Tehran. This included allowing Iran to continue enriching uranium with over 5,,,,,,
4802, the United States secretly paid Iran $400 million in ransom to swap five innocent Americans imprisoned by Iran for the release by the U.S. of seven Iranian criminals and the removal of 14 other Iranians from an INTERPOL wanted list. According to a bombshell December 18," """"The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah off the Hook",""""" the Obama administration also blocked an investigation of drug trafficking by Hezbollah - Iran's terrorist proxy - to secure the nuclear deal.",,,,
4803," however. Iran's behavior got worse. It sent troops into Syria after the deal was announced. It continued to support the Houthi rebels in Yemen and gave them missiles that they used to attack Saudi Arabia and ships in the Red Sea. It also has proceeded with its ballistic-missile program and tested some missiles with the words """"Israel must be wiped off the map"""" emblazoned on them.",,,,,,
4804," Tehran reportedly pledged $70 million to the Palestinian terrorist group Islamic Jihad to conduct """"jihad"""" against the State of Israel. In 2017",,,,,,

4812,,,,,,,
4813, it is very unlikely that Senators Bob Corker (R., in part because of trade deals it struck with Iran after the accord came into effect. And to no one's surprise, Iran is adamant that it will never renegotiate the JCPOA.,,,,
4814,,,,,,,
4815, there may be three undisclosed reasons behind his move that suggest he plans to withdraw from the agreement in the near future. The first two reasons are based on a discussion about the Iran deal that a friend of mine had with the president last month.,,,,,,
4816, Trump told my friend that even though he gave Congress 90 days in October to pass legislation to fix the JCPOA,,,,,,
4817,,,,,,,
4818, he told my friend, it makes sense that President Trump might want to delay gutting the Iran deal at this time.,,,,,
4819, Trump might be postponing a decision to exit the JCPOA until they are replaced by advisers who will fully support and aggressively implement such a decision.,,,,,,
4820, he also authored a plan last August on how the U.S could withdraw from the JCPOA and work with our allies - especially Israel - to replace it with a much better arrangement. Making Ambassador Bolton the next national-security adviser could end the infighting in the administration on the Iran deal and also would probably improve the implementation of Trump's national-security policies on radical Islam, Russia, China,,,,

7092, you will feel as though you are being pulled in 20 different directions. Family, recreational commitments and more will continue to get between you and your career efforts, slowly down the progress you were hoping to make during this time. Not all of these distractions are going to be negative – you may be celebrating a family member’s new baby or helping a friend move into their new house,,,,

Try not to stress too much as they are likely minor challenges that appear to be much larger at first glance.

From missed and canceled flights to vehicle breakdowns and overbooked hotels, to hold off on any vacations until after the July total eclipse when this energy shifts back to positivity and success.,,,,,
7113, however, so embrace this while you feel the call to do so! You may also feel as though there are things inside you that are dying. It’s not a comfortable or happy feeling but know that this is making room for new things to take their place. This may result in some significant changes. For example, you may feel the need to step back from hobbies that were once your passion to follow a different path. You may also question the church or religious institution you are attending,,,,
7114,,,,,,,
7115, this is certainly not the time! Avoid any dangerous sports or hobbies, such as your spirituality. If you have been dabbling with high-risk practices such as spirit summoning or astral traveling, it may be best to put your efforts on hold until after the July lunar eclipse.,,,,

7677, but should a woman carry full-term a baby she doesn’t want and was violated into having? I had to struggle with this question. Can a woman be responsible before God for having been raped? I came to the conclusion that somehow, I put the onus on the rapist. If a man rapes a woman, and she has an abortion, has to be responsible unless she has been raped. Then I decided that murder can only be defined by a woman making a decision to have an abortion and then going through with it. A lot more goes into it than just making a decision. There might be others involved in making that decision with her. And what about forgiving women who have had abortions? I struggled with all this. I did some research and found out that about a third of all women have had abortions. I can’t just write off one-third of half of humanity. But the Pope now says that women who have had abortions really should be forgiven by the Church.,,,

9150, 48 million Americans get sick from foodborne diseases and 3, salmonella and clostridium perfringens as the top three illness-causing germs. Bugs that are more likely to lead to hospital stays include botulism, listeria and E. coli. E. coli cases linked to red meat are down,,,,
9151, Marler has come up with a list of seven foods he never eats:,,,,,,
9152,,,,,,,
9153, including alfalfa, are at the top of Marler’s list.,,,,,
9154,” he said. “Seeds get contaminated and then when you sprout things in warm water,,,,,,
9155, a website run by a former professor of food safety,,,,,,
9156, Wisconsin and Minnesota since December,,,,,,
9157, the government advises. Children, and people with weakened immune systems should avoid eating any raw sprouts, it notes.,,,,
9158,,,,,,,
9159, it’s not worth the risk, including kidney failure and paralysis.,,,,,
9160, viruses,” the CDC warns. Possible germs include campylobacter, E. coli,,,,
9161, if you’re making it at home in a clean environment, the risks are very low, Marler said. Just skip any packaged “raw” juice.,,,,
9162,” he said. “You just sort of scratch your head and wonder what people are thinking.”,,,,,,
9163,,,,,,,
9164, so resist the temptation to eat cookie dough or taste raw cake batter.,,,,,,
9165, you have to consider it a raw agricultural product that could be the source of a pathogen,,,,,,
9166, so wipe things down and consider using wax paper instead,,,,,,
9167,,,,,,,
9168, the less likely it is to be a problem, cut it and put it in a plastic bag for lunch than to go to the grocery store and buy an apple that was sliced a few days ago in facility 500 miles away.,,,,,
9169, but sometimes I think the convenience isn’t worth the risk, but if I did, I would wash it again myself. It’s all about decreasing the bacterial load.”,,,,
9170,,,,,,,
9171, Marler said. That’s because bacteria on the surface of the meat can get mixed throughout the product when it’s ground. Be sure to cook ground beef, the CDC notes.,,,,,
9172, like filet mignon, he noted. The CDC recommends cooking it to an internal temperature of 165°F.,,,,,
9173, Marler isn’t that concerned about raw fish,,,,,,
9174,,,,,,,
9175, perhaps because the water is warmer for longer periods of time,,,,,,

Judicial Watch is seeking the information through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. Judicial Watch sought “the copy of the budget prepared or submitted” by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But, the Justice Department notified Judicial Watch that it refuses to turn over documents, stating: “seven pages were located that contain records responsive to your … request. We have determined that this material should be withheld in full because it is protected from disclosure under the FOIA.” The Justice Department asserts the Mueller budget information cannot be released because its release could interfere with “law enforcement proceedings” and the material is protected from disclosure by the “deliberative process privilege.”,,,,

Google’s troublesome new ‘Fact Check Display’ for conservative publications is the resurrection of the Merrimack-Harvard Library fake news list that began to circulate the Internet more than a year ago. Look at the graphics below to see the striking similarities in style between the Google Fact Check Display and the Merrimack-Harvard Library Fake News list. The massive Merrimack-Harvard database of “fake, false, is now getting a Google resurgence. Why would Google, copy the style of the Merrimack-Harvard Library Fake News List? Because it’s the intention of the progressive left via social media to prevent conservative publications from getting their message out over the Internet. They’ve plunged the conservative voice into an inky darkness from which they believe there will be no return. “A few conservative critics predicted early on that the recent obsession with fake news would lead eventually to right-of-center newsrooms being lumped with the bad actors.(Washington Examiner March 11, is now displaying fact checks for conservative publications in its results.” No prominent liberal site receives the same treatment.,

Rather than turning off the lights, Facebook and Twitter—not even with all their significant might—could get Hillary Clinton elected as president, but instead blame Fake News on their abysmal failure. It must be to their utter frustration knowing that there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel as long as readers continue to search online to find the publications of their choice.,,,,

9971, we discuss what nuclear war would look like with a former nuclear war planner and one of the world’s most famous whistleblowers—Daniel Ellsberg. In 1971, published Tuesday, is titled “The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner.” We speak with Ellsberg about his top-secret nuclear studies,,,,
9972,,,,,,,
9973,,,,,,,
9974, mobilizing warships, quote, “nuclear demon.” Earlier this year,,,,
9975, today we’re joined for the hour by a nuclear war planner to discuss what nuclear war would look like. He is already well known for another reason, including a secret dramatic escalation of troops and bombings in what looked like an unwinnable war. He photocopied and shared the 7,000-page document with The New York Times and other publications. The report came to be known as the Pentagon Papers and played a key role in ending the Vietnam War.,,,,
9976, few know that 10 years before, where he drafted plans for nuclear war. In his book, just out this week, in which he did not discuss this other set of papers. He’s the subject of the Oscar-nominated documentary The Most Dangerous Man in America. Dan Ellsberg will be a character in the forthcoming Steven Spielberg film about the Pentagon Papers called The Post.,,,
9977, we’ll speak with Dan Ellsberg for the hour about nuclear war,,,,,,
9978,,,,,,,
9979, with Juan González. We’re joined by Dan Ellsberg for the hour, in fact, decades ago: writing up plans for a nuclear war. His book details this,,,,
9980, you made copies of top-secret reports for plans about nuclear war years before you copied the Pentagon Papers—,,,,,,
9981,,,,,,,
9982,,,,,,,
9983, my notes, but on plans that were then unknown to the president, to begin with, like the delegation of authority to theater commanders for nuclear war by President Eisenhower, even though Kennedy chose to renew that delegation,,
9984, which was not a very high bar, because they were, on their face,,,,
9985, which was by order of President Eisenhower. He didn’t want any plan for limited war of any kind with the Soviet Union, under any circumstances, such as an encounter in the Berlin corridor, or Yugoslavia, for example—however it got started, assuming the Soviets had not used nuclear weapons.,
9986, in our first strike,000—in the USSR and every city in China. A war with Russia would inevitably involve immediate attacks on every city in China. In the course of doing this—pardon me—there were no reserves. Everything was to be thrown as soon as it was available—it was a vast trucking operation of thermonuclear weapons—over to the USSR, but not only the USSR. The captive nations, their transport points, as well.,,
9987, when I saw these, many calculations. But not victims.,,,,,
9988, I drafted a question, sent to the joint chiefs in the name of the president. And the question was: In the event of your carrying out your general nuclear war plans, which were first-strike plans, by the way, “We have to have more time. We’ve never really calculated that.” I was wrong. And my friends were wrong in the Air Force. They came back with an answer very quickly: 325 million people in the USSR and China alone.,,
9989, actually, no question. West Europe would go, under any circumstances. If we were defending West Europe—Germany,,,,
9990, that was a hundred Holocausts. And when I held the piece of paper in my hand that had that figure, proudly, to the president—”Here’s what we will do”—I thought, like Herman Kahn might have conceived at the doomsday machine that he thought up at the RAND Corporation as my colleague. This was an actual war plan for how we would use the existing weapons,,,
9991, the colossal carnage that they were envisioning as a result of this first-strike use was doubly—made doubly worse, that many people have the capacity to initiate a nuclear war. If you could you talk about that, as well?,,,,
9992, even if it were only the president, and every president has had that power, and this president does have that power.,,,,
9993, which emphasize his sole authority to do that, had delegated, in fact,,,,
9994, in '61, commander-in-chief of Pacific, for whom I worked as a researcher, in turn, “How many altogether feel authorized?” if their communications are cut off—and that happened part of every day in the Pacific when I was there—communications got better,,
9995, hitting Moscow, by the way, with their smaller forces—and when that became clear, which assured that if Moscow was destroyed,,,
9996, as a number of our military always recommended, generally, they allow for lower-level majors,,,,
9997, when you heard about President Trump having that meeting with the joint chiefs of staff in the summertime,” that apparently was in response to Trump asking three times in that meeting, “If we have nuclear weapons,,,,
9998, he had asked that, to people during the campaign a year earlier. And an answer to that, of course,,,,
9999, whether or not you pull the trigger. And both Trump and Kim are using their weapons in that encounter right now, perhaps three dozen cases, mostly in secret, “Oh, every hour of the day,,
10000, they’re being pointed. And they’re being pointed by two people who are giving very good imitations of being crazy. That’s dangerous. I hope they’re pretending. They might be pretending. But to pretend to be crazy with nuclear weapons is not a safe game. It’s a game of chicken. Nuclear chicken.,,,,,,
10001, this is an excerpt of President Kennedy’s address to the nation at the time of the Cuban missile crisis,,,,,,
10002, my fellow citizens. This government, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.,,,,,
10003, that was President Kennedy. Can you talk about your own experience of the Cuban missile crisis in October of 1962? Talk about what you were doing. This is before you released the Pentagon Papers years later.,,,,,,
10004, I remember, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Harry Rowen, later president of RAND,” which I did.,,,
10005, sorry, while we were—I was on several task forces, working for the Executive Committee, with higher than top-secret access, I didn’t learn many of the things that are most important about that crisis,,
10006, here we were threatening to invade Cuba. It was not a way to keep the Cubans from acquiring a deterrent force, essentially, don’t seem a very well-chosen way to get Kim Jong-un to give up his deterrent capability in the—in North Korea. But that’s what we were doing.,,,,
10007,,,,,,,
10008, we came within a hair’s breadth of blowing the world up, who thought they were being—going to go down, actually, whose assent was needed,,,
10009, but he was there. And since he was the commodore, we didn’t blow a cruiser out of the water and cause the nuclear explosion that Kennedy had already announced would cause an all-out attack on the Soviet Union. That’s why we’re still here.,,,,,
10010, again,,,,,,
10011, in the '90s, by the way, were the exact counterpart of what Kim Jong-un is trying to do now. Khrushchev had decided that his ability to destroy our allies directly, even though doing that would force us to go to tactical nuclear war. So he said, medium-range missiles that would be in range of the U.S.,,
10012, in the case of Cuba—so he’s building ICBMs that can reach the U.S.,,,,,,
10013, moreover, and even low-level reconnaissance planes, that managed not to discover that he had put tactical nuclear weapons, that’s almost necessary tactically. You can’t wait on Moscow if an invasion fleet is coming at you. But we didn’t think he would ever do that.,,,
10014, actually. And his theory was, short-range missiles. They can only blow the invasion fleet out of the water, kill 100, “That’s insane. To think that we could lose 100,,,
10015, that he could initiate war against our forces in South Korea and keep it limited. That’s insane. But it’s no more insane than our plan to initiate nuclear war against Russia,,,,,,
10016, then come back to our conversation. We’re talking with Daniel Ellsberg. Yes, yes, that is what he did,,,,
10017,,,,,,,
10018, with Juan González.,,,,,,
10019, we’re spending the hour with Daniel Ellsberg, just two years after the Cuban missile crisis.,,,,,
10020, from lunatic General Jack D. Ripper, who want to proceed with the attack despite his hesitation. They hit a snag when the Soviet ambassador informs them of Russia’s new weapon: a doomsday machine that will destroy the entire world if they’re attacked. So, in this scene from the film, based on a study he commissioned from the so-called BLAND Corporation.,,,
10021, how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically,,,,,,
10022, it is not only possible, because of the automated and irrevocable decision-making process which rules out human meddling, the doomsday machine is terrifying,,,,
10023, I wish we had one of them doomsday machines.,,,,,,
10024, which is also the title of our guest Daniel Ellsberg’s new book,,,,,,
10025, with the delegation, and therefore have the incentive to use them or lose them if there’s warning of an attack on the way. Now, false warnings have occurred on both sides repeatedly and gone into several minutes. In 1995, because of what was in fact a Norwegian weather rocket that was mistaken for a rocket that might be headed at Moscow for decapitation. And he hesitated, at that time, because the nuclear winter resulting from the attack on one side, would have produced smoke that long ago would have starved us and nearly everyone else on Earth.
10026, when you hear the news accounts now of the threats of North Korea and the response of the president, of the dangers of nuclear weapons, seemed a lot greater throughout the United States than it is today.,,,,
10027, these are the first threats that any American president—and American presidents have made many nuclear threats, more than half a century ago, against a nuclear weapon state. Harry Truman made nuclear threats 67 years ago against North Korea, left not a stick of man-made structure left standing in North Korea. So they all remember that if they’re President Trump’s age or older,,,
10028, they wouldn’t send them back at us, as he’s implied, would be killed. Should we count that they won’t do that, with nuclear weapons, and striking second is better than not striking at all. It’s crazy,,
10029, you have said that the Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning,000 classified files and videos to WikiLeaks about U.S. foreign policy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Manning had been sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, after she was convicted under the World War I-era Espionage Act. In January,,,,

10036,,,,,,,
10037, of course, as President Trump is moving us toward, actually, as was true half a century ago,,,

How plausible is this?,,,,,,

10970, viable babies in the third trimester of pregnancy – and then murdered these newborns by severing their spinal cords with scissors. The medical practice by which he carried out this business was a filthy fraud in which he overdosed his patients with dangerous drugs, on at least two occasions, caused their deaths.,,,,
10971, but because it documents that a lot of what was later universally condemned about Gosnell’s abortion business had been known throughout the Pennsylvania regulatory agencies for years – but no one lifted a finger to stop it.,,,,,,
10972, with one Gosnell employee saying “it would rain fetuses – fetuses and blood all over the place,,,,,,
10973,” it was stunning when top news organizations from the New York Times to the Washington Post suddenly proclaimed their outrage over Gosnell’s abortion crimes and the lack of news coverage.,,,,,,
10974,” wrote liberal Democrat and Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers in an impassioned and widely read USA Today column. “Haven’t heard about these sickening accusations? It’s not your fault,,,,,,
10975, there has been precious little coverage of the case that should be on every news show and front page. The revolting revelations of Gosnell’s former staff,,,,,,

10977,,,,,,,
10978,,,,,,,
10979,,,,,,,
10980,” intoned the Atlantic’s headline. Yes,,,,,,
10981, but exploiting women – scaring and pressuring them, essentially conning them from start to finish – is the central operating principle of the abortion industry. If women were counseled with absolute honesty, candor and full disclosure, has resulted in death for many and permanent injury, sterility and soul-scarring heartache for countless more.,,
10982, which somehow is more offended by racism than almost anything else in this life, Planned Parenthood, was an unapologetic racist and eugenics proponent who openly advocated for discouraging blacks and other “inferior races” from breeding. To this day,,,,

10984,” asked Mark Crutcher, “why is everyone so upset over Kermit Gosnell?”,,,,,

10986,” Crutcher told me during the Gosnell trial,,,,,,
10987, “Lime 5: Exploited by Choice, was accused of sexually assaulting more than 160 women.,,,,,
10988,,,,,,,
10989, and the dream world where killing the exact same baby at the exact same age is a “woman’s fundamental right” – forces us to confront a peculiar question: Where did the killing occur?,,,,,,
10990, the babies Gosnell was convicted of murdering were no older, more human or more precious than other late-term babies aborted routinely over the past 40 years. It’s just that Gosnell pulled them out of their mother before killing them. Had he done exactly the same horrendous things (like “snipping” infants’ spinal cords) while the baby was still inside the mother, many who today express horror would have regarded it as just another late-term “women’s health procedure” that mother and doctor determined to be in her best interest.,,,,
10991, abortion in America under Roe v. Wade is legal from the moment of conception until the moment of birth, sign authorization forms claiming the mother risks becoming, oh let’s just say,,,,
10992, Powers forthrightly confronted this now-institutionalized mass delusion: “… [W]hether Gosnell was killing the infants one second after they left the womb instead of partially inside or completely inside the womb – as in a routine late-term abortion – is merely a matter of geography. That one is murder and the other is a legal procedure is morally irreconcilable.”,,,,,,
10993, one based on self-evident truth and valuing human life,,,,,,
10994, we have determined as a modern, whenever and wherever we want, and we repudiate any notion that we must take responsibility for the natural result of sex – which is children. Having committed so deeply to this proposition, chemically burned alive, without its clothes.,,
10995, as an Illinois state senator, despite the abortionist’s “best efforts,” are born alive – in other words, the born) child,,,
10996,,,,,,,
10997,” women are advised: “Had unprotected sex? Just take the morning-after pill.” A few weeks later, “Just have a suction abortion. It’s not a baby.” Yet with each passing week of gestation, the delusion becomes more difficult to sustain. For in just a few more weeks, prosecuted as a criminal and sentenced to life without parole. “Any doctor, Philly DA Seth Williams, who would survive with proper medical attention,
10998, we endlessly draw magic lines – arbitrary points before which killing babies is a revered constitutional right,” “20 weeks” and “viability.”,,,,,
10999, overshadowing all these magic lines is an even more arbitrary and irrational measure of infant humanity – namely, but whose parents don’t want it, is considered worthless medical waste.,,,,
11000,,,,,,,
11001,,,,,,,
11002, these two warring worlds – the world of love and life versus the world of selfishness and death – inevitably collide somewhere along this continuum. After all, the only major difference between his and other abortionists’ killings was that his were visible – outside the mother where others could see it.,,,,,
11003,000 other late-term abortions every year in today’s America? Is “snipping” more inhumane than forcibly ripping apart human babies limb from limb, pulling the living baby feet-first into the birth canal, except for the head,,,,
11004, but not toward the multitude of other equally abominable but legally sanctioned killings that have scarred and bloodied our nation for more than four decades?,,,,,,
11005, including the “mainstream media,,,,,,
11006, we fervently embrace child murder.,,,,,,
11007,,,,,,,
11008, extraordinary things happen. In the after burn of the Gosnell trial and society’s rare moral condemnation (the “bad doctor” got three life sentences for multiple first-degree murders of babies),,,,,,
11009, 2013. Just four weeks later, explicitly drafted to prevent the kind of horrors Gosnell had committed by banning abortions past 20 weeks gestation, i.e. late-term abortions. Exceptions for the life and physical health of the mother were included,,,,
11010, our once-unified nation has become a place of warring opposites. Where light shines,,,,,,
11011, two weeks later on June 25, engaged in an 11-hour filibuster (wearing a urinary catheter so she could stay the course) to block passage of the late-term abortion bill before the midnight end of the Texas legislative session.,,,,,
11012, with the Associated Press reporting: “Thousands of people watched it live online, Davis succeeded in blocking the bill’s passage – for a few weeks, anyway – later parlaying her newfound celebrity into an unsuccessful run for the Texas governorship in 2014.,,,,
11013, Davis insisted that late-term abortion is, she justified her actions to stop the late-term abortion ban by proclaiming, “I’ll seek common ground – we all must – but sometimes you have to take a stand on sacred ground.” In this, Pelosi refused to answer,,,
11014,” “sickening,,,,,,

The Texas Tribune described the surreal scene at the state capital and what the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) was forced to deal with:,,,,,
11019, requiring them to throw away paper goods such as magazines, paint and glitter in bags. … DPS officers have thus far discovered one jar suspected to contain urine, 18 jars suspected to contain feces,,,,
11020, just a few months later,,,,,,
11021, the truth about abortion is dawning – not just due to the Gosnell trial, and because of the tireless work of pro-life groups and individuals continually shining a light on the very dark reality of abortion and providing help to desperate women in need of genuine love and support – and because monumental denial must ultimately, sooner or later,,,,
11022, more Americans considered themselves “pro-choice” than “pro-life” by a huge 20-point margin, and in 2014, a nationwide CNN poll showed Americans continuing to trend pro-life, a quarter century ago,176 surgical abortion clinics in the U.S. Today, and the decline has accelerated in recent years.,

11024, even a peaceful prayer vigil can sometimes enrage abortion advocates because “it reminds them of the horrible day they took the life of their child.”,,,,,,

Secretary Duncan testified that 82 percent of the nation’s schools would likely fail to meet the law’s requirements — thus subjecting them to crippling sanctions. The Obama administration dangled billions of dollars through the “Race to the Top” competition, the Department would give states a waiver from NCLB’s requirements so long as they adopted the Obama administration’s preferred policies — essentially making law while Congress negotiated the reauthorization of ESEA. Unsurprisingly, nearly every state accepted Common Core standards and applied for hundreds of millions of dollars in “Race to the Top” funds. But despite this change, came the public backlash to federally imposed tests and the Common Core.

13849, the FBI lovers’ correspondence provides factual evidence exposing much of the made-up “Resistance” narrative – the contrived storyline that The New York Times and much of the rest of the U.S. mainstream media deemed fit to print with little skepticism and few if any caveats,,,,,,

13856, such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell, fueled by the growing hysteria around Russia-gate.,,,,,
13857, the Times and other newspapers of record repeated the lie that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies had concurred in the conclusion about the Russian “hack.” Even when that falsehood was belatedly acknowledged,,,,,,
13858,,,,,,,
13859, but anyone who noted the violations of normal investigative procedures was dismissed as a “Trump enabler” or a “Moscow stooge.”,,,,,,

13863, Trump, the widow, the stranger and other vulnerable humans. That was always an underlying danger of the Resistance’s strategy to seize on whatever weapons were available – no matter how reckless or unfair – to “get Trump.”,,,,
13864, Russia-gate has become so central to the Washington establishment’s storyline that there appears to be no room for second-thoughts or turning back. The momentum is such that some Democrats and the media never-Trumpers can’t stop stoking the smoke of Russia-gate and holding out hope against hope that it will somehow justify Trump’s impeachment.,,,,,,
13865, the sordid process of using legal/investigative means to settle political scores further compromises the principle of the “rule of law” and integrity of journalism in the eyes of many Americans. After a year of Russia-gate,,,,,,

13867, Strzok reportedly changed the words “grossly negligent” (which could have triggered legal prosecution) to the far less serious “extremely careless” in FBI Director James Comey’s depiction of Clinton’s actions.

13871, elitism and scheming would be revealed in so tangible a way. Worst of all for them, worked so hard to achieve — the sabotaging of Trump and immunization of Mrs. Clinton and her closest advisers is now coming apart at the seams.,,,,,

13930, the nation is engulfed in controversy over statues of people who fought for the Confederacy. Many people want the statues taken down. The statues, slavery proponents, and traitors. Those who want the statues to stay in place are said to be racists. The feelings run so deep on both sides of the controversy that one would think that the Civil War ended just yesterday.,,,,
13931, I question why government should erect statues in the first place,,,,,,

13944,,,,,,,
13945, people are simply saying,,,,,,
13946, people are essentially responding,,,,,,

13948, I believe that Lincoln himself began realizing that as the war progressed and the death and destruction mounted exponentially. When he provoked the incident at Fort Sumter,,,,,,
13949, D.C., with the federal team winning. Once it was clear that the Confederate forces were prevailing in the battle, the D.C. socialites and sightseers ran for their lives back to D.C. in fear that they would be captured or killed.,,,,
13950,,,,,,,
13951, people have accused the secessionists of being traitors. They say that it was treason for Jefferson Davis, Jeb Stuart, and others to secede from the Union.,,,,
13952, which many people believed, federal officials took Davis into custody and threatened to prosecute him for treason. Deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, however,,,,
13953, one that exposes the hypocrisy of those who condemn the South for seceding. That point is: The United States itself was founded on secession. And most of the people who condemn the South for seceding nonetheless celebrate America’s secession from Great Britain in 1776.,,,,,,
13954, but that’s really a misnomer. It wasn’t a revolution at all. A revolution is an attempt by rebels to oust the existing regime and take control of the central government. That’s not what the American colonists in 1776 were doing. They had no interest in taking control over the British government. They simply wanted to secede from it.,,,,,,
13955, just as people in the Confederacy were American citizens. The British colonies were part of Great Britain, and the Virgin Islands are part of the United States today.,,,,,
13956, “We don’t want to be part of your country anymore. We don’t want to associate with you. We wish to establish our own country.” They didn’t want to take over the British government. They simply wanted to secede from Great Britain and establish their own country,,,,,,
13957, some Americans celebrate George Washington, and Patrick Henry as patriots for seceding from their country while, at the same time,,,,
13958, often it’s a question of who wins and who loses that determines whether a secessionist is a patriot or a traitor. Great Britain certainly did not consider its rebelling British colonists to be patriots. On the contrary, Lee, Jackson,,,,

13968,,,,,,,
13969, they would use the plural form: “The United States are moving in a different direction.” Sometime after the Civil War and continuing through today,,,,,,
13970, to do so would constitute treason because it would entail waging war against his own country, notwithstanding the fact that their system was based on slavery. That is, they would have had the mindset with respect to patriotism even if there had been no slavery in the South.,,,,
13971,,,,,,,
13972, U.S. forces could have invaded the Confederacy, leaving the Confederacy as an independent nation. After all, doesn’t the U.S. government justify some of its foreign interventions in that way today? After the infamous WMDs failed to be immediately found in Iraq,,,,
13973, free the slaves,,,,,,
13974, there was another way to bring an end to slavery without all the massive death and destruction that Lincoln’s war entailed. The North could have acceded to the secession and then declared itself to be a sanctuary for runaway slaves.,,,,,,
13975, which required Northern states to return slaves to their owners? It would have been gone. Remember: with secession,,,,,,
13976, slavery was a dying institution anyway,,,,,,
13977,,,,,,,
13978, in the matter of statues and the honoring and glorification of Union leaders, especially in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley and in Sherman’s March to the Sea.,,,,,

13980, the U.S. carpet bombing of North Korean towns and villages, and the several missile and drone attacks on wedding parties in Afghanistan. Every one of those war crimes is based on the notion that it’s okay as long as it saves American lives by ending the war sooner, especially by demoralizing the enemy. They all stretch back to the war crimes that Sheridan and Sherman committed in the South.,,,,
13981,,,,,,,
13982, let’s not forget that while Lincoln opposed slavery prior to being elected president,,,,,,

Post the taper announcement last year it had looked like ECB meetings would be uneventful for much of the start of this year however the December ECB minutes and some of the subsequent news reports have at least added a fair bit of anticipation to today’s meeting. Our European Economists expect Mario Draghi to prepare the ground for changes to forward guidance at today’s press conference by differentiating policy expectations from the policy reaction function within forward guidance. The internal committees may be tasked with studying the options for guidance. Otherwise the team expect the January press conference to contain the same rhetoric as December – rising confidence but no change to the policy stance. EUR appreciation will probably be a talking point, the endogenous appreciation defense remains valid and the policy exit debate will remain live.,,,,,
15290, Hang Seng (-0.20%) and China’s CSI300 (-0.36%) are all down while the Kospi is bucking the trend to be up 0.93%. Elsewhere,,,,,,
15291, CAC (-0.72%) and peripheral bourses also fell (0.5%-1%). The FTSE 100 (-1.14%) also felt the weight of the Sterling rally and had its worst day since October. By contrast the S&P 500 closed marginally lower (-0.06%) while the Dow rose 0.16% and Nasdaq fell 0.61%,,,,,,
15292, WTI oil jumped 2.19% to $65.88/bbl after EIA data showed US crude stockpiles fell for the tenth week to the lowest level since February 2015. Brent oil also rose to $70.75/bbl – the highest since June 2015. Elsewhere,,,,,,
15293, Germany’s Merkel warned against “right-wing populism” as it is “a poison that appears whenever you have unresolved problems”. She noted Germany has its own difficulties, as unilateral solutions …simply promote isolation and protectionism”. Elsewhere, she stood firm on Brexit,,,,
15294, Canada’s Chief negotiator Verheul told Reuters he had “a constructive conversion” with his US counterpart re the NAFTA deal and will unveil ideas on how to meet a US demand for higher North American auto content soon. In our US economists note, and Mexican economies in the unlikely event that a NAFTA breakup occurs.,,,,,
15295, Brexit Secretary Davis has signalled a desire for some kind of status quo post Brexit which may have helped Sterling yesterday. He noted Britain will stay close to EU’s regulatory regime after it leaves the EU bloc and sees his task as “…maintaining the maximum possible access to the European market..” and creating “the freedom” to allow the government to diverge later on if it choose to do so.,,,,,,
15296, we wrap up with other data releases from yesterday. In the US, the January composite PMI was lower than last month’s reading at 53.8 (vs. 54.1), with a stronger manufacturing PMI (55.5 vs. 55 expected) offset by a lower than expected services PMI (53.3 vs. 54.3).,,,,
15297, there seemed to be a theme of weaker manufacturing PMI offset by stronger services PMI. In Germany, the composite PMI was also above market (59.7 vs. 59.2) with the weakness in manufacturing PMI offset by a stronger services PMI (57 vs. 55 expected).,,,,,
15298, labour market conditions remain strong with the November unemployment rate remaining at a 43 year low and steady at 4.3%,,,,,,
15299, the main event is the ECB monetary policy meeting. President Draghi is scheduled to hold a press conference following the meeting outcome. Data releases include February consumer confidence and the January IFO readings in Germany, December new home sales, December leading index and January Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity index in the US. Before tomorrow morning Japan will print December CPI and publish the latest BoJ meeting minutes. Intel and Caterpillar are scheduled to release earnings with the latter always a good bellwether for the global economy.,,,,

15729, the sense of this passage is a little different from Luke 11. In Luke 11 His words are, it is “pray like this….” The difference is significant. Luke 11 tells us to recite the prayer; cultural context tells us we are to do that three times each day. Matt. 6 tells us that this is a model that we should use as a guide and outline for our own prayers. In other words, the Lord’s Prayer tells us what Jesus’ prayer priorities are and what ours should be when we engage in extemporaneous prayer.,,,,

Strzok and Page seem to have been so invested in the stop-Trump-at-all-costs mission that even after he won - the very definition of failing to stop him - they weren’t quite ready to process it was time to move on. They’d already compromised the integrity of the FBI by covering up Hillary’s claims while trumping up charges against Trump, right?,,,,,

Peter Strzok—a top counterintelligence official involved in both the Hillary Clinton email probe and FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe—exchanged more than 50, R-S.C., and Rep. John Ratcliffe,” Ratcliffe said Monday on Fox News’ “The Story with Martha MacCallum.”,,,
16516, but when folks speak in those terms, these two supposed to be objective fact-centric FBI agents, saying that perhaps this is the first meeting of the ‘secret society, who reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would resign if Trump or Sessions fired McCabe.

Was there good reason for Strzok to believe he could attempt to organize such a thing without fearing reprisals from Comey or McCabe? Was the good reason that he knew the higher-ups at the FBI shared his disdain for Trump and would be willing to let the FBI be used as a political weapon against the commander in chief?,,

Here’s how it looks to me as we stand right now: The FBI intentionally spiked charges against Hillary for her felonious gross negligence in the handling of classified material, were looking for a way to cook up a criminal investigation of Trump, regardless of how flimsy the rationale. The behavior of the FBI and the Justice Department - stonewalling and dragging their feet over subpoena compliance - is consistent with the theory that these things were going on and they don’t want it exposed.

16731, we did so for one reason: the church atmosphere slid away from true biblical values toward the emotional, in determining how God is speaking to them, how He is directing them, quietly,,,
16732, piano and trumpet eventually took a back seat and that was mainly due to the fact that we did not have a piano so I couldn’t practice routinely. I eventually got out of high school and stopped playing trumpet. I continued playing drums because in the 1970’s, falling in love, etc.,,,,
16733, over time, a software program that can take any voice through the computer and adjust it automatically so that all flats or sharps from the singer are digitally placed in tune. Same with the instruments. There is also plenty of overdubbing in today’s music. Unlike what was called “the wall of sound” from the Wrecking Crew in the 1960’s where there were literally multiples of the same instrument playing different tracks, today’s music is simply digitally overdubbed and perfected.,,,,
16734, most groups who tour today often have canned music and audio tracks playing with their live sound. You don’t really want to hear them without it because the groups that were hits when I was a younger person and are still touring are pushing their 70s now. They’re really old and should have stopped a while ago,,,,,,
16735, the hymns were hymns, didn’t take a great deal of work, the songs themselves followed the instinctual route of good,,,,
16736, nothing stays the same. I began noticing that in place of these simple choruses (often based directly on the Psalms or other portions of Scripture), with discordant notes and tunes. Instead of adding to the worship, it seemed like they were attracting more of the attention.,,,,
16737, worship songs have become these heavily convoluted, all set on a firm foundation of bombastic drumming. If you take away the lyrics of many of today’s so-called worship songs, they could easily be mistaken for what passes as secular music. There’s nothing uplifting about it,,,,
16738, but to the direction this music pulled the church. It has led me to believe that the more the music is given free rein and center stage,,,,,,
16739, churches are filled with people who shed tears while they are singing. They sway, and emote in a variety of ways – all because of the music. I have to wonder why?,,,,,
16740, I believe there is something off kilter. These same people who cry because of the music (or words), and they see words, but often the words do not impact them in any real sustainable way. They aren’t moved by the bare facts of Scripture related to God,,,,
16741, on Sunday mornings, the drums banging away and the singers all staring at the ceiling with arms raised, somehow this is enough to bring grown men and women to tears. I frankly don’t get it. I mean,,,,
16742, not closer to Him. Do these same folks shed tears of joy over some of the classic hymns that reveal Scriptural truth?Instead,,,,,,

17312, Father, they believe themselves to be entitled to such things and to have a free will to choose such things, even though their choices cause then to sink into darkness and despair,,,,
17313, I have forsaken such things as television and movies, I can only say that You heard my cries towards You! You knew that I longed for You, but I was lost and could not find You in the churches. Therefore,,,,
17314, that was almost twenty-one years ago and almost twenty-three years ago since You visited me and healed my broken heart. Father, which You brought upon my very head! For, these corrections were sorely needed for me to see the errors of My ways and to repent of many,,,,
17315, My Lord, but continue on with their dysfunctional lives.,,,,,
17316, My Little One,,,,,,
17317, My Lord, You promised me that You would allow me to see the salvation of the greatest numbers, so how will this be when the greatest numbers will not seek You,,,,

17319, My Little One; and so true it is! And, and do not love Me, I will begin to take away what they masses love,,,,
17320,,,,,,,
17321, I have already shown you what I have done! Look and behold, I have torn up My contract with this nation! I take first one half and put it into the flames; and I take then the other half and put it into the flames! Do you hear Me, oh people of America? I no longer sit at the head of this nation! Satan,,,,

17338, who choose righteousness, will pay dearly! They will pay through great suffering in their bodies. They will suffer great losses in their families and among their friends; for Satan will seek to cause them grief in all ways! Many will forsake them and rise up to bear false witness against them; for Satan will enter into them, even as he entered into Judas, to slander their good names, even to kill them.,,

17345, you wicked and adulterous generation! For so long I have pleaded! But, you find another way and this other way is full of rot and filth, but you see it not! For, you remain in your comfortable place in the midst of your worldly desires, you continue on and your life remains the same. Therefore,,

17361,,,,,,,
17362, thank You, this document is like a small diary and I see that it is locked, but I see now that the key is fastened to the side of this diary; so I will remove the key, “My Life!”,,,
17363, I turn it again and nothing happens, so I turn the key again and the cover of this little book flies open as if it is spring-loaded! Father, I do not know what to think about this little diary; for there are many pages, especially of no value to the one,,,
17364, do you know why I showed you such a diary?,,,,,,
17365, I think that I have some ideas, I would rather hear what You have to say about the diary!,,,,,
17366, the name of this diary is “My Life.” These words, this diary could belong to anyone!,,,,,
17367, Father,,,,,,
17368,,,,,,,
17369, in their Minds,,,,,,
17370, this is the very sad state regarding the diaries of the lives of most people on this planet! Very few have a whole diary! Very few have whole lives; for trauma, sadness, lost hope and dreams, the sorrow, and to thereby bring these things to Me for healing!,,
17371, what most do is to cover up their great sufferings from past years with mountains of busy work, lusts, drugs, so much of their pain in their dysfunctional lives,,,
17372, when they bring their diaries to Me, in their souls and in their spirits! For, they have stored up within themselves, sorrow, embarrassment and other kinds of negative emotions and thoughts; and they try to hide these things from themselves and from others!,,
17373, in their thinking and feeling,,,,,,
17374, many of these are the whited sepulchers! They look good on the outside and they sound good; but on the inside they are a wreck! For, sorrow and forgiveness; and until they resolve all of these situations with Me, they will not be whole and clean before Me!,,,,
17375,,,,,,,
17376,,,,,,,
17377, this message is most important, it you will not clean out your spiritual closets now; and if you die in this state, you will come again and again until you clean them out, some of you, and I cannot and will not marry you! Therefore, will listen! Hearken to me,
17378,,,,,,,
17379, or She will not be Healed!,,,,,,
17380, this book is a diary and this diary could be anyone’s diary! With the first look at one’s self, the spirits of denial may block ones entrance into his or her own book. And, not only will spirits of denial block ones entry into ones own diary,,,,
17381, many do not wish to look into their own lives and re-experience the pain and suffering so that they can be free! There is also, or behaviors, especially when they are negative or unacceptable!,,,,
17382, instance, one may grow up to deny the emotion of sadness, but may instead hide behind a jovial front! So,,,,
17383, not only must one claim his or her true emotions, this is why you needed to turn the key three times.,,,,,
17384,,,,,,,
17385, others to clearly view the past hurts and emotions, initial attempts to truly access such painful emotions or memories may be blocked by the mind, where the mind often seals away painful memories. Or the initial attempts may be blocked by hardness in the heart, fear, and has thereby become hardened! So, as well as the truths of what other have done to them!,
17386, I show you this now; for many will sit down to look at all of their hurts, or almost blank. For, they have built such walls in their thoughts and in their hearts. Do you understand?,,,,
17387, My Lord,,,,,,
17388, in some situations, as was and is the case with Elena. And, this is one reason that I am raising up My Little Son of light, which will completely dissolve and heal such memories and their associated emotions.,,,
17389,,,,,,,
17390,,,,,,,
17391, as far as these diaries, most will remember well their greatest numbers of emotional traumas and mental traumas. Most will remember well who hurt them and also will remember well how they hurt others. They will also see well how they hurt others! They will also see well that they have not dealt with all of the hurt, the pain and suffering,,,,
17392, these I will readily help if they will honestly and truthfully address these many emotional and mental traumas, in their hearts and in their souls; and it is these sorts of things, which must be healed before one can be free!,,,,
17393, these emotional and mental scars are something like road maps and these road maps, and to prod one to repeat the same sorts of things over and over again! If this is not the case, it will nonetheless take a great deal of emotional,,,,
17394, Trying to Fill the,,,,,,
17395,,,,,,,
17396, many are afraid to look into these voids, or what they did to others!,,,,,
17397, there shall come no healing into them, into their bodies, until they look back,,,,
17398, if any and all are sincere in their pleas before Me, I will heal them! I will forgive them! I will set them free; and make them new persons, from the inside out. This is what I will do for any and all,,,,
17399,,,,,,,

17406, Father, I come to You as a child, Father; and I seek You as a child, Father; and I know that I have not only caused great pain to myself by some of my many bad decisions,,,
17407, I have not wanted to think about many of these painful events; for the burden of such things is so great in my heart and in my mind! But, even though I wish to forget about so many of these very traumatic events and to go on with my life, I cannot forget them!,,,,
17408, I have truly wanted You to hear Me and to forgive Me regarding many of these painful behaviors and painful events, my soul is heavy with so much pain and suffering! Father, I want to be free! With all of my heart,,,,
17409, take my hand and go with me into the diary of my own life! Give me very clear eyes so that I may recall with great clarity all of these hurtful and unresolved situations, in my memories and in my thoughts. Father, please take my hand and walk with me into all of these hurtful and painful situations,,,,
17410, burn down the walls, which is within me! Father, cause me to look upon my life, which have so troubled me; for, I do not wish to blame others any longer for my own bad choices. I do not wish to treat others unfairly because I will not forgive them, oh Lord,
17411, please take my hand and hold tight to my hand and walk with me into the diary of my own life; for I truly wish to be free! Thank you,,,,,,
17412,,,,,,,
17413, My Little One, even praying it with their whole hearts, I will hear this prayer! I will honor this prayer and I will indeed take the hand of such a one,,,,
17414,,,,,,,
17415, my Little One, with his or her whole heart, there is much work to be done and this is what I would have each one to do! Make lists! Make three distinct lists and the first list is to be called: 1. What others have done to me! Then,,,,
17416, as one spends time with Me in going back into his or her life; and as one sees and reviews the painful and unresolved conflicts, indeed three lists, and on the three lists, in three lists: 1. What others have done to me; 2…What I have done to others; 3…What I have done to myself.,,,
17417, my Little One, without any interruptions whatsoever! In deep longing and with a singleness of purpose, one needs to spend this time of deep prayer and longing with Me, or even weeks! For,,,
17418, the one,,,,,,
17419, you will come next with the following prayer and with your whole heart, that I may also forgive you and others, as you must also forgive yourself.,,,,

17422, there will come a great freedom in your mind, I will heal those of you, who so desire this healing with your whole hearts! And, and I will eventually heal you and clean away all of your emotional and mental traumas regarding these situations.,,,
17423, here follows the second prayer and you are to pray this prayer regarding each emotionally charged situation, as well, on your behalf,,,,
17424,,,,,,,
17425,,,,,,,
17426, Lord Jesus, I travail over so much sorrow and so much pain in my life! Lord, You know the emotional trauma that I have suffered over this incident alone; and You know that I do not want to suffer this emotional pain regarding this situation any longer! Father,,,,
17427, please bring Your love and Your light and your healing into this very painful emotional situation and heal me! Heal my painful memories and painful emotions and heal my body,,,,,,
17428, oh Lord, who is and has been a part of this very painful situation, including myself. Lord,,,,
17429, I really do want to be forever free of all such painful memories and emotions,,,,,,
17430, please heal me in every way regarding this situation and take all of my burdens regarding this painful event. For, which have arisen in me, because of this terrible event.,,,,
17431, Oh Lord, which were not good for me and for others.,,,,,
17432, all of these terrible memories have served as my own prison and none could help me to be healed. But, so that we might find our way into the Light, for this earth is do dark. You, none can heal like you!,,,
17433, I know that you are extremely compassionate and that you forgive. I truly do want to be forgiven of all of my sins and I beg you to forgive me of all of my sins and to heal me completely of these past errors and very terrible memories! I know that you hear my cries and I know that you are mindful of me. Thank you,,,,,,

17435, with these two prayers, and if you pray with your whole hearts, and with great determination, who will receive them and pray them in earnest! For,,,
17436, keep coming back to Me in prayer and keep praying the same prayer until you feel this spiritual breakthrough! For, I will heal you; but remember also that things, like doubt and a lackadaisical attitude can interfere in your healing,,,,
17437, remember that the walls, spirit and soul, may not be broken down all at once, you will need to be determined and to persevere; and if you will be determined and persevere,,,
17438, I wish to add that even after you have made such lists, memories and emotionally charged situations may still surface. And, when these surface, who persevere and pray with your whole hearts, if you are sincere and pray these prayers and do this work with your whole hearts.,,
17439, My Little Ones,,,,,,
17440, there will come those, but they do not have Your Spirit. Father, they need Your Spirit,,,,
17441, the following is the third prayer for those, it fled; and if they never had My Spirit, they most certainly need it! Therefore, mercy,,,
17442,,,,,,,
17443,,,,,,,
17444, oh Blessed Saviour, I do not want any holes in my heart or in My spiritual makeup anymore; for these holes are also places for demons to hide in. Oh, Blessed Saviour, who have the Spirit of God, so that I may receive Your Spirit.,,
17445, I so deeply desire Your Spirit; for I do not wish to be like the heathen, Oh Blessed Saviour!,,,,,
17446, I also ask You to send Your great power into me and to drive every demon out of me, help me to be mindful of wrong behaviors and to be mindful of behaviors, which will insult or drive out Your Spirit! For,,,,
17447, Jesus! I want to know You in an even greater way; and if it would be Your will, lost and cut off!,,,,,
17448, I know that without Your Spirit, my soul will burn; for I will be counted among the rejects! Father, I do not want this! Have mercy on Me! Please bless me to have Your Spirit and help me to do what is right; for I so greatly treasure Your Spirit! Don’t let me perish,,,,
17449, for each one, know one thing, that I will visit this one, but many in the churches, do not even have My Spirit!,,
17450, in these end-times, just as I have told you, and I will so impart My Spirit! This prayer will also benefit many in My house, but are as dead wood! So, who have never had My Spirit, and have not repented!,
17451, which I will indeed honor, and a very great tool for salvation! For, if one has My Spirit, there is still hope for many! Hear Me in this! This is a very important prayer!,,,
17452, if you are not sure whether you have the Spirit of God, but day after day, with a whole heart, praying these three prayers,,,
17453, I will close this section! Take these teachings very, forgiveness and obedience towards Me, loving Me above all and loving and forgiving others, which you could or would ever imagine!,,,

He helped to financially break the communist Soviet Union’s currency and in the process amassed a large fortune of over 27 Trillion dollars in Gold and other assets. This money was supposed to help rebuild our infrastructure and build a high speed rail system. But then Leo Wanta was illegally arrested and the money was stolen by H.W.

18305,,,,,,,
18306, it is so important to be able to tell the difference between the common cold and the flu. The H3N2 strain is a subtype of Influenza A that is particularly hard on less robust populations. This would include young children, and anyone with a compromised immune system, such as diabetics and cancer patients.,,,,
18307, H3N2 is proving deadly to healthy adults in addition to the more at-risk groups just mentioned. In my neck of the woods, and they all thought it was just a cold. A 21-year old fitness buff and a healthy 20-year old mom have also died from the flu.,,,,,
18308, these are not your usual influenza death demographics. The fact that this is the 100-year anniversary of the “Spanish Flu” of 1918, it is a sobering reminder of how easily influenza can mutate.,,,,,
18309, this year’s flu vaccine has proven less than effective at preventing infection. It is estimated that this year’s flu vaccine is only 10% effective at preventing the flu. Influenza A strains are generally more serious than Influenza B or C strains and mutate more frequently. A higher rate of mutation means a greater chance our immune systems will be unprepared to fight it.,,,,,,

18334,,,,,,,
18335, but we need to talk a little bit about phlegm. Doctors always ask if the phlegm you cough up, it was just a cold. If it were yellow or green, it was a bacterial infection,,,,
18336, the color of your phlegm is an indicator of how hard your immune system is working. The color is produced by a large concentration of infection-fighting white blood cells called neutrophils. Neutrophils have an enzyme that lends the green color. The color can be more noticeable because the mucus has become thick,,,,,,
18337, green is an indicator that your immune system is really working hard. It is not a way to distinguish between a viral or bacterial infection. However, it is a good indicator that you have a serious infection and should get checked out ASAP.,,,,,

18401, the January 31st supermoon will feature a total lunar eclipse, which would normally reflect off the Moon. “The lunar eclipse on January 31 will be visible during moonset. Folks in the Eastern United States, where the eclipse will be partial, totally eclipsed Moons are sometimes called ‘blood Moons.’ “We’re seeing all of the Earth’s sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon, a Program Scientist at NASA headquarters. The January 31st supermoon will also be the second full Moon of the month. Some people call the second full Moon in a month a Blue Moon, it’ll be a royal spectacle indeed: a ‘super blue blood’ Moon. Sometimes the celestial rhythms sync up just right to wow us. Heed your calendar reminders.,
18402, technically the supermoon will occur on the night before but it will have some influence on the full moon itself on the 31st. Unlike the solar eclipse, as it takes place at night. Lunar eclipses do not happen every month because of how tilted the plane of the lunar orbit is in relation to the plane of the Earth’s orbit.,,,,,

19275, Doxey Wilkerson, and leader of the American Federation of Teachers, broke with Gunnar Myrdal and the Carnegie Corporation funded project,” instead attributing racism to the hearts and values of Southern whites. Myrdal put forth this idealist interpretation of race relations to propound the liberal vision of his corporate funders, but also the exclusion of the eminent scholar W.E.B. DuBois, 1860-1880,
19276, arguing that it brought “to finest expression practically all the vacuous theories of race relations which are acceptable among the liberal intelligentsia and which explain race relations away from the social and economic order.” Interestingly,” published in the October 2017 issue of The Atlantic. The article epitomizes the fundamental aporia of Coates’ brand of Black liberalism: that whiteness and racism constitute and stabilize U.S. politics even as they present an “existential danger to the country and the world.” In other words, whiteness and racism are totalizing structures,,,,
19277,,,,,,,
19278, and racists elected Trump because of whiteness. The use of tropological abstractions, “human plunder” (invoked ad nauseam in other of Coates’ works) and “bloody heirloom,” have the effect of mollifying and mystifying antiblackness rather than clarifying it. “Human plunder” dirempts forms of racialized exploitation and dispossession from their specific relations to the mode of production, as it has since 1776, at the very least, spatial segregation, and deepening impoverishment.
19279, then we need not interrogate that the complex phenomena he simplistically calls “whiteness” are reproduced through specific technologies of racialized violence historically situated in regimes of capitalist expansion, and anti-imperialism as seditious and anti-American. In other words, the subjection of Blacks throughout U.S. history cannot be reduced to some identitarian notion of whiteness that culminates in the election of Donald Trump; rather, the indictment of communists and “fellow travellers, and the overall repression of the left.,,

20680, it’s a clear warning to businesses inside AND outside of California to not move to (or remain in) the Golden State. No state is so anti-business as California.

I 100% endorse and support all those saying Obama’s the Antichrist BECAUSE INDEED OBAMA IS THE ANTICHRIST and only those who step forth and stand up to be counted will be added to THE CHOSEN IN THE END TIMES as the Bible says. So be it and let it rip! i.e. let the Apocalypse BEGIN!,,,,,,
20728, I’m saying this to you solemnly here:,,,,,,
20729,,,,,,,
20730, we’re related to the Bernadottes. Indeed,,,,,,
20731,,,,,,,
20732,,,,,,,
20733, one of the Norwegian Royal Court Ladies,,,,,,
20734, if anyone does,,,,,,
20735,,,,,,,
20736, I’m also revealing among other that Obama’s real name is Barry Parks; he’s the son of Jim T. Parks.,,,,,,
20737, investigate that by Googling it.,,,,,,
20738, because all Christians will be corrupted and none will be saved in the end days said Jesus. But “no one knows the day and hour of that news being spread”, so the truth will hit when it’s ready. My being the Messiah or Jesus isn’t the issue as because of being a Buddhist I have no stakes in being the Christian Messiah. But what counts is that Christians are losing their grasp on the Apocalypse because they’re not rising up to be counted as the chosen ones. They’re not rising to reveal the Antichrist Obama/ and that’s a damning factor for them and a factor that will send them to eternal hell from what the Bible says and if the Bible is to be believed. There are Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse at BIN that have appeared out of nowhere! They all agree with me that Obama’s the Antichrist: they are reporters THE LIGHT, David Montaigne,,,,
20739, let’s look at my youth when I was brought up in the USA and France to a family influenced by Theosophy and schooling such as Rudolf Steiner’s schools. Theosophy’s basic influence is Buddhism from Helena Blavatsky’s Russian background where the influence of Tibetan Buddhism is rife due to the Mongolian Buddhists within the Russian Federation of nations.,,,,,,
20740, who also was himself influenced by Buddhism and Theosophy.,,,,,,
20741,,,,,,,
20742, when I reached 15 years old,,,,,,

20744, I sought to pass on my knowledge on Internet and particularly my research upon Kalachakra the deity-teachings which announce the Apocalypse within Tibetan Buddhism.,,,,,,
20745,,,,,,,
20746, that set up a red alert signal to me and during the whole of 2007 I dedicated myself solely to fighting against Obama’s election.,,,,,,
20747, I sought to find the most powerful anti-Obama video that I could find on You Tube so as to go and find people to share my convictions with.,,,,,,
20748, forums, articles’ comments on Internet etc…so as to criticise and block Obama but I ended up on the video with most views and most comments that deals with the birther issue: Obama Citizenship: I Invented the Internet (Ep. 6: October Surprise),,,,,

20760,,,,,,,
20761,2008 – Pick 3 and they’ll find that the draw was indeed 666 on that day.,,,,,,
20762,,,,,,,
20763, I set out to Christian websites to announce to them that Obama was revealed as the Antichrist by a miracle sent from heaven.,,,,,,
20764,,,,,,,
20765, my logic during the first years of Obama’s power was that I wasn’t interested in being the Messiah.,,,,,,
20766, I am a Buddhist and very content with that. I have no wish to be Christian seeing I’m an ex-Christian.,,,,,,
20767,,,,,,,
20768,,,,,,,
20769,,,,,,,

20772, I had set my goal on revealing that Obama was the Antichrist of Christianity: indeed,,,,,,
20773,,,,,,,
20774, home-delivery,,,,,,
20775, Christianity is alien to me. So I wouldn’t want to even be caught dead being the Christian Messiah. I had the idea I’d just drop off the message – like a mailman – and MOVE ON to other stuff (my mission as a Buddhist fits with the King of Shambhala prophecy of the world’s saviour and not with the Christian prophecy of the “Messiah”).,,,,,,
20776,,,,,,,
20777, they more or less grabbed me and dragged me inside for an in-depth soul-searching conversation and scan of my innermost soul. But I got fed up with the spiritual moments with them….as I’ll explain now.,,,,,,
20778, they went BEZERK and harrassed me with questions about who I was and what my beliefs were. It was a mix of fear and awe at me. Very scary.,,,,,,
20779, because to them in their book,,,,,,
20780, that I got mad and said: “Like the message or not I’m the Messenger. I never said I’m the Messiah,,,,,,
20781, that people in the comments just can’t get their heads around it.,,,,,,

20797, because such a rallying of forces was only possible by one single person and that was the Antichrist,,,,,,
20798, and fighting Obama through the birth issue battle,,,,,,
20799, prejudiced thinking is not practised at all BIN. The only thinking that’s accepted there is out-of-the-box,,,,,,
20800, seeing I was fleeing the middle-ages thinking of Christians, kinds and form. Obama really draws evil to him. I was searching for any place in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD where I could freely say Obama’s the Antichrist and put forth my proof of that without being targeted by Jihadist-style, medieval people.,,,,
20801,,,,,,,
20802, I set up making articles regularly,,,,,,
20803,,,,,,,
20804, the most anti-Christian people I met in the world, stock and barrel, he who is the most anti-Christian of all time = seeing he’s the Antichrist..,,,,
20805, that as I was a Buddhist, they denied the divine heaven-sent miracle of 666 cursing Obama.,,,,,
20806, because I had never ever exchanged with Christians since converting to Buddhism,,,,,,
20807, being of Christian background myself,,,,,,
20808, the proof that I’m indeed the Messiah and Jesus’ Second Coming is clear: there’s no doubt possible.,,,,,,
20809, Christians who say I’m disqualifed as a Buddhist to be the Messiah and Jesus,,,,,,
20810, all Christians would be corrupted and to not follow them when they invoked him. He himself would not return as a Christian because of that widespread corruption.,,,,,,
20811, all Christians who claim I’m not the Messiah are furthermore also false christs because the Bible states that no one will know the day and hour of the Second Coming of Jesus.,,,,,,

20825, when I state I’m the Messiah and Jesus,,,,,,
20826,,,,,,,
20827,,,,,,,
20828, the fact that Obama’s cursed by 666 in the lottery is a sign sent by heaven.,,,,,,
20829, making up or exploiting for my benefit. Indeed,,,,,,
20830,,,,,,,
20831, I could have just remained a silent witness and waited around for some other person to stand up could and proclaim in the news medias that Obama was the Antichrist. People would have gathered around that person and hailed him or her as the Messiah and Jesus’ Second Coming. But nobody has stood up to do that since eight years now.,,,,,,
20832,,,,,,,
20833, for a few years,,,,,,
20834, so I didn’t think I had to stand up to the Christians and proclaim myself as Messiah to fend off their criticisms..,,,,,,
20835,,,,,,,
20836,,,,,,,
20837, seeing my facts are ironclad concerning the lottery draw of 666,,,,,,
20838, is the signal of the end of times and Apocalypse….,,,,,,
20839, during my battle to reveal Obama as the Antichrist among may people fighting to spread information about Obama I met upon Linda Joy Adams (browse for “Daily Recap”) and we quickly hit it off as friends and “kin on the path” of searching for the truth. Her story made the hair rise on my head. She claims she’s Obama’s third cousin and his real name is Barry parks,,,,,,
20840,,,,,,,
20841, can change that truth because I alone reveal that the lottery in Obama’s homestate drew 666 (the Mark of the Beast aka the Number of the Antichrist) the day after his election. Wikipedia says that to troll is a pathological behaviour. Ignore the trolls: they’re crazy.,,,,,,

20891, many shooters are unaware that guns chambered in .327 Federal Mag can also fire both .32 H&R Mag, the .32 ACP chambers fine and some shooters use that as well. Pressures in all of the older rounds are much lower, but be aware the formula does not work in reverse. Like the relationship between .38 Special and .357 Magnum,,,,
20892, the .327 Mag is a pretty straightforward bench job. Though it’s called a .327,000 psi MAP from SAAMI, allowing for a wide range of powders and loads.,,,,
20893, from 85- to 115- grain along with offerings in everything from snubby revolvers to longer wheelguns to Henry lever action rifles makes the .327 a versatile round. It can be a very effective personal defense caliber with low recoil (albeit quite loud), at reasonable ranges.,,,,,

22237, I’ve been on both sides of this issue. It is an interesting debate. I understand the mainstreaming mindset because I used to be one. The same is true of Matt Parrott. The truth is that our people shift in between mainstreaming and vanguardism. When they are feeling optimistic about reforming the system,,,,,,
22238, I am sure we will all emerge on the same side of this debate. Mainstreaming is running out of time. We’re on the precipice of mainstream politics failing for good. We’ve only got around 20 years now until we are an outright racial minority in the United States.,,,,,,

Identity Evropa isn’t the first White Nationalist group to be stigmatized and marginalized as just another “hate group.” The difference here is that Identity Evropa imagines itself to be a higher status group which has no basis in fact.,,,,,,
22247, presentation (optics + message/rhetoric) does matter. When I discovered /pol/ in 2012 and learned the truth about various controversial issues, Neo-Nazi groups, which I found completely unappealing for more reasons than “optics.” Years later,,,,

22251, the WN 1.0 approach didn’t alienate either of us, idealistic young people from coming into the White Nationalist movement. This is because WN 1.0 was never synonymous with Neo-Nazis, Klansmen and skinheads. It always included more buttoned down real world groups like American Renaissance and the Council of Conservative Citizens.,,,,
22252, this attitude is incorrect because all of us were “normies” before seeing the light. (The term “normie” is used within the context of nationalism to refer to a non-nationalist. If Hunter has a more arcane definition of the term,,,,,,
22253, then and only then will we start winning over the average White American. Until then,,,,,,

22256, “normie” is an overly broad category that masks a range of personality types outside the movement. Some people are more intellectually curious and altruistic than others.

22264, it should be noted that the average age at recent White Lives Matter rallies appears to be upwards of 30, have been doing this for decades.

22272, I don’t know about this.,,,,,,
22273, the rise of AfD was driven by Merkel’s migration crisis and especially by PEGIDA,,,,,,
22274, the success Identity Evropa has achieved since forming in May 2016 is evidence that what we’re doing is working.

22275, but a reporter tipped off Antifa and we had to cancel it. There is nothing wrong with banner drops either. I’ve also been talking about the importance of building social bonds off the internet for years now. In our case,,,,,,
22276, the Alt-Right blew up because it was not 1.0. It created its own culture, etc. that was far more creative, funny, and opting for transgression over strategy. This is why I believe the term Identitarian is a preferable description for what I’m involved with. …”,,,
22277, there was no social media at the time. The Alt-Right rose with social media and the smartphone after 2007. Patrick is also rewriting the history of the Trump campaign. The explosion of the Alt-Right on Twitter was always transgressive. It began with the #cuckservative meme in the summer of 2015. It was the Alt-Right at its most vicious in terms of trolling conservatives and journalists in gangs. I mean, milquetoast case for the Alt-Right; it was brutal. The truth is that things have calmed down on Twitter after the censorship.,,,,,

22598, Switzerland (World Economic Forum)* – Decades of prioritizing economic growth over social equity has led to historically high levels of wealth and income inequality and caused governments to miss out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared more widely and generated without unduly straining the environment or burdening future generations. Even It Up Campaign — Oxfam International These are the findings from the World Economic Forum’s Inclusive Development Index 2018,,,,,,

22602, only 12 of the 29 advanced economies were successful in reducing poverty and only eight saw a decrease in income inequality.

22606, Germany (12) ranks the highest. It is followed by Canada (17), the United States (23), Japan (24) and Italy (27). In many countries, on the other hand, it ranks 12 for Inclusion. Its low ranking on Intergenerational Equity (24) suggests it may be storing up problems for the future.,,
22607, Hungary (2), Croatia (7) and Romania (10). These countries perform well on Growth and Development, benefiting from EU membership, Uruguay (8) and Chile (9). Over the past five years, social inclusion has fallen or been unchanged in 20 of 29 advanced economies and intergenerational equity has deteriorated in 56 of 74 emerging economies,,
22608, with the Russian Federation ranking 19th, India (62) and South Africa (69). Although China ranks first among emerging economies in GDP per capita growth (6.8%) and labour productivity growth (6.7%) since 2012, its overall score is brought down by lacklustre performance on Inclusion. Other emerging countries such as Mexico (24),,,,

22610, but only 10 of 29 have registered clear progress in the IDI’s Inclusion pillar. A majority, and the remaining three have remained stable. A majority of those countries with the best GDP growth performance failed to improve on Inclusion. This pattern is repeated in the relationship between GDP growth and performance on Intergenerational Equity and Sustainability with 11 of 29 showing clear progress and 18 of 29 deteriorating. .,,,,,

Bible Bill promised to end the depression with a monthly distribution of $25 (the equivalent of $400 in today’s money) to every family in Alberta. The British North American Act (Canada’s constitution at the time) kept Aberhart from acting on his impulses when his Social Credit Party swept to power in 1935,,,,,,

The new leader of the Social Credit Party shared his mentor’s fascination with the imminent end of the world but quickly distanced himself from the radical aspects of depression-era politics.

23088, the progressive religion taught at Union Theological Seminary in New York and proclaimed in the pages of the Christian Century was closely aligned with the Washington political establishment. John D. Rockefeller and his heirs had a lot to do with that. The Rockefellers used their vast wealth to bankroll the University of Chicago, and make it possible for Union Seminary to attract the likes of the Niebuhr brothers and Paul Tillich.,,,,,
23089, American Protestantism was much less polarized than it is now. John D. Rockefeller followed evangelists like Dwight L. Moody and Billy Sunday with interest and cautious approval even as he poured millions into the “modernist” University of Chicago.

Hunt of Dallas and Sid Richardson of Fort Worth.,,,,
23092, J. Howard Pew became fascinated by the Athabasca Tar Sands and started reaching out to Ernest Manning. Vast oil reserves were being discovered throughout the Arab world and Manning was touting Alberta as an attractive alternative for American investors.,,,,,,
23093, he thought it was nobody’s business what he did with the money God alone had given him.,,,,,,

The controversial Keystone XL Pipeline running from Northern Alberta to Houston and Port Arthur in Texas, is a natural development of this marriage between conservative religion and big oil.,,,,

Both religious visions hitched their wagons to different stars in the political firmament and were far more dependent on the generosity of fabulously wealthy families than is commonly realized.,,,,,

He began his speech with what is a fascinating inside look into the specific direct action campaigns they had undertaken in the previous 10 years and the progress they had made. But then he concedes, as he does in other letters and speeches, noted that one of their obstacles was the lack of urgency among their white allies who (like me in 2000) were simply unable to see how pervasive the problem is and didn’t live under its weight.,,,,

It’s a challenge to remember what my mother told me: “Bullies are often the most insecure people.”,,,,,,
23113, this is not in any way to soften or water down the evil that is committed against vulnerable human beings or the urgency with which we must protect their life and liberty. Neither King nor Jesus ever shied away from calling evil for what it is, and other icons of the civil rights movement is their unwavering commitment to show love and respect even to those who did them harm, never lashing out or countering evil with evil. They all drew from the example of Jesus who saw the darkness in the human heart as something to be redeemed and restored,,,,

23848, “Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?” But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did–if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather,,,,,,
23849, “It’s 2017!” as an argument for abandoning some traditional or conservative moral scruple, in itself, enlightened.,,,,
23850, and their beliefs about morality were irrational. Thus,,,,,,
23851, while always present to some degree in the human heart, engaging in unrepentant sexual immorality would lead one to eternal damnation and isolation from God, Who is the source of all life and well-being. Thus,,,,
23852, or only by condemning such illicit acts, and to smear their motives as bigotry, is itself bigotry,,,,
23853, let’s take it one step further: What if we in 2017 are wrong, and of Hell, which we still know is a real place,,,,
23854, that would turn our self-important accusations around. It would mean not only that we have to answer for our sins against one another in this life and the life to come, were the truly bigoted ones.,,,,,

23856,2226,http://breakpoint.org/2017/11/why-the-violinist-argument-for-abortion-fails-a-poorly-tuned-analogy/,"""If you’ve spent any time debating the issue of abortion", they are surprisingly flimsy and easy to answer,,,
23857, I’ll answer the oldest, circulation, and perhaps immune function. You are completely healthy, however,,,
23858, you are within your rights to unplug and let the violinist die, has a right to use your body against your will. You have complete autonomy over yourself, and no one–not even a stranger who is there through no choice of his or her own–has a valid claim on you. Applying this analogy to abortion,,,,
23859, but the violinist argument is actually filled with fatal holes. As Greg Koukl points out,,,,,,
23860, no. First of all, was not drugged and forced to support another life with her body. She engaged in an activity (sex) which not only causes but is expressly designed to create life. It is because of her choices (along with the father’s) that the tiny human growing in her womb exists. No one forced her to have sex. In biological terms, engaging in the reproductive act and then being surprised when a baby shows up is like pulling a lever marked “adopt a puppy” and then being surprised when a puppy slides out of the chute.,,,,
23861, a stranger who happens to be skilled with the violin is not analogous to a person’s own child. It is not immediately obvious that I have a moral obligation to support any random person who comes to depend on me, and so forth. It is much easier to argue that I, as a parent,,,,
23862, in Thompson’s analogy, as the host, had nothing to do with it. But again, did not ask to be conceived. He or she is much more plausibly the victim,,,
23863, Thompson’s analogy depends on the principle of total bodily autonomy. “My body, without any qualifying boundaries or commitments, then I should be able to go anywhere I want. But we all agree that I can’t simply go wherever I want, because the way in which I use my body affects others, then a breast-feeding mother should be able to simply withdraw nourishment from her child and let it die. After all, according to Thompson’s principles.,
23864,,,,,,,
23865, far from being a powerful argument for abortion, 2.) the life dependent on her body is not a stranger, but her own child,,,,
23866, the host merely withdraws support from the musician and allows him to die of natural causes. In an actual surgical abortion,,,,,,
23867, if we were to recast this analogy to better reflect the actual situation of a mother seeking an elective abortion, and hooking him up to my body for dialysis, circulation, since suddenly disconnecting from him is hazardous to my health,,,
23868,,,,,,,
23869, and worded in such a way as to paint the parents who want to abort their child as victims,,,,,,
23870, in which someone coerces a woman and can potentially impregnate her against her will. Sexual intercourse is not consensual, but the reasoning is somewhat different. I will leave the question aside for another time.,,,,,
23871, I’ll tackle the second, a “gotcha” argument that, if anything,,,,
23872,,,,,,,
23873,,,,,,,
23874,,,,,,,
23875,2227,http://breakpoint.org/2017/12/abortions-new-gotcha-argument/,"""In my last article on abortion",,,,
23876, it was invented by author Patrick Tomlinson in a tweetstorm (which you can read in full,,,,,,
23877, boasting, he says, only two possible replies. Picking either of them “destroys” the argument that life begins at conception. What precisely Tomlinson would consider an “honest” answer is left vague.,,,,
23878,,,,,,,
23879,,,,,,,
23880, you see a container marked “1,000 viable human embryos?,,,,,
23881, this is an impossible choice for a pro-lifer, then the 1,000 embryos must outweigh the life of the child. He claims that the pro-lifer instinctively knows which is the right choice—to save the child. But this choice,,,,
23882, except as a means of controlling women’s bodies. “Slap that big P for ‘Patriarchy’ on [those pro-lifers],,,,,,
23883,,,,,,,
23884, and it’s not even close. His argument turns on two false assumptions that say more about the depth of his ethical analysis than about pro-lifers’ actual priorities. The first is that the act of choosing between a child and a box of embryos reflects a person’s beliefs about the humanity of either. Debunking this is as simple as replacing the characters in Tomlinson’s scenario.,,,,,,
23885,,,,,,,
23886, your choice upon bursting into the burning room is between your mother and your own child. You can save only one. What do you do? According to Tomlinson’s “gotcha” reasoning, and vice-versa.,,,,,
23887, the hard choice of which one to save is not likely a reflection of who the rescuer thinks is more human.,,,,,,
23888, the decision may simply be random, and simply not taken the time to evaluate the crying child on the opposite side of the room before charging in to save the first human being you saw. In other situations, the choice could be motivated by utilitarian concerns. Will the doctor you rescue be more likely to save lives in the future than the terminal cancer patient? Can the rocket scientist expect to enjoy a better life than the garbage collector? These questions may sound crass,,,,
23889, the choice to save the 5-year-old over the embryos (which I think any decent person would make) is a simple matter of triage: How can you best allocate scarce, and strength) when demand is higher than supply? Who has a better chance of survival—the child, or the embryos,,,,
23890, or the person whose heart was perforated in a gas explosion and will not likely survive the night? Paramedics and nurses must make split-second decisions that often result in death,,,,,,
23891,,,,,,,
23892, again, ten thousand, or even a million viable embryos.,,,,
23893, consciousness, we might just as easily claim to have nailed him to the wall on the humanity of unconscious children. Again, how silly.,,,,
23894, as well as connections with family members who would suffer the kind of loss or grief at their demise that the family members of the 5-year-old would. These considerations can easily outweigh the case for saving the embryos,,,,,,
23895, it surely pales in comparison with the lifelong guilt and agony that would result from hearing the screams of a dying child and nonetheless leaving him or her behind. We rightly and naturally feel great compassion for human persons whose faces we can see, obeying such altruistic urges says nothing about when embryos become human.,,,,,
23896,,,,,,,
23897, as John Stonestreet notes on The Point,,,,,,
23898, in the name of reproductive freedom. All Tomlinson’s scenario proves is the fogginess of pro-choice thinking.,,,,,,

24068, but to put it simply it is this: Hillary and Obama along with members of the FBI and DNC paid British spy Christopher Steel who has Russian connections 12 million dollars to write a fake dossier on Trump with salacious details to use against him in the campaign.,,,,,,
24069, it was a third-rate burglary that was sent in to tap his phones. This was a brought and paid for the phony dossier on a current presidential candidate to use against him. This is the biggest scandal in modern American history and the mainstream media is by passing it up because it involves Hillary and Obama. This is a massive abuse of power like the world has never seen.,,,,,,
24070, Hilary arranged for the sale of 20% our Uranium which we import to a Russian company for 145 million dollars laundered through Canada to her Clinton Foundation. That is the real Russian collusion.,,,,,,
24071, as the election approached, Hillary Clinton had voted to allow Moscow to buy a company that controlled one-fifth of our uranium. When Schweizer coupled his revelation with the fact that Vladimir Putin had paid a $500,000 speaking fee Putin to Bill Clinton a few weeks before the vote,,,,
24072, given an advance copy of Schweitzer’s book, above the fold. Hillary could not afford to have the media publicize the Russian spy plot to bribe their way into control of uranium. It would have cast Hillary’s vote in a very bad light. Yet the fact is that right around the time that Hillary voted to sell our uranium, the FBI closed in on a spy ring of up to a dozen Russian agents who had been bribing uranium and transportation companies to aid in giving Moscow leverage.,,,,

24124, atonement is understood to mean the reconciling work of God to humanity through Jesus’ death on the cross.

Their blatant misrepresentation of their need for federal involvement in decision-making and correction-issuing caused the delay. And their concealment of the name of the falsely reported single “guy” who “pushed the wrong button” is generally maddening; while his monitored actions were likely sabotaged by cyber-hacking. Could the wrong message have been hacked into the vulnerable system causing the “right button” to broadcast a 38-minute statewide disaster? Nothing explains what happened better,,,,,,

This was someone we could depend on. There had to be more to it.”,,,,

Chatham House’s foundational mission is to secure the markets as changing international issues and current affairs challenge global commerce. The global think tank’s scholarly treatment of the hottest topics in military “defense strategy” compounds the evidence we see compounding in Maj. Gen. Miyagi’s camp in Hawaii. Chatham House scholars best explain the assault Hawaii officials are ill-prepared to recognize as it hides beneath the mask of a civil defense cyber-fed video display prompting life-threatening actions. “Technological advances and the human factor mean it is no longer sufficient (or perhaps even possible) to isolate computer systems from the internet,,,,

It shows how vulnerable we are to those on government payrolls administering “preparedness” and “defense strategies.” It shows the most advanced technologies and communications systems are susceptible to human errors. And it shows we are not protected from ego-maniacs in politics targeting any city with a nuclear bomb.

24284, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, the kind of speech the First Amendment was primarily designed to keep within the area of free discussion.

26072, George Gele and Company were denied a permit to explore the area by the Louisiana Archaelogical Survey and Antiquities Commission,,,,,,

26078, he found a couple who were particularly adept-virtual “psychic archaeologists” who eventually “discovered” the pyramid Gele expects to find peeking up from under the slimy bottom less that 20 feet from the surface of the water.,,,,,,
26079, Dunn and their psychic archaeologists are right, will be only the beginning. To hear them tell it, there is still no hard evidence to prove why the pyramids exist.,,,,
26080, the pyramid at Chandeleur Island (if it exists) is part of an “energy grid” defined by lines drawn on a map from that point to a point near the mouth of the Mississippi River to something the size of the Superdome. Those lines define a triangle which in turn happens to share the same proportion of a side of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Given how much both Dunn and Gele like to speculate, provide enough fodder for a lifetime of “what ifs.”,,,,,
26081,,,,,,,
26082, he met Gele at a gathering in Baton Rouge one night as Gele was trying to persuade a group of people to join an expedition. At that meeting,,,,,,
26083, that would make it 300 feet taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza- a revelation which fairly overwhelms any attempt to describe or explain how it was built.,,,,,,
26084, that it is at the same latitude of the “big pyramid” (Yet another mind-boggling revelation) that lies in the Gulf of Mexico several hundred miles,,,,,,

26147, this triangle-shaped area extends from a point off the coast of Japan southward to Guam Island, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, the Devil’s Deep a notorious graveyard for ships and planes. (Much of the following data are from Joan Whritenour and Saucer Snoop,,,,
26148, the triangular shape of the Devil’s Deep shouldn’t be taken too literally. Although most of the ship and plane losses occur within the triangle, an extraordinary number of ships and planes vanish; seldom are the wrecks or bodies found. And seldom are distress calls from these ships or planes received.,,,,,
26149,,,,,,,
26150, both the Bermuda Triangle and Devil’s Triangle are situated between 15 and 30 degrees latitude and extend about 20 degrees longitude-and they are nearly opposite one another on two sides of the northern hemisphere. Another grim similarity is that both are just off the coasts of highly populated areas with enor­mous air-sea traffic-America and the China-Japan complex, between 1949 and 1955 in the Devil’s Deep, nine ships disappeared with a total of 215 lives lost.,,,,

26163, 1957. Five crewmen of the fishing boat, creating a violent turbu­lence. The spot was in the topmost apex of the Devil’s Triangle, at 143′ 30″ North and 31′ 15″ East.,,,,

26173, Marshall Islands, and his buddy spied a ‘bright UFO that drifted across the base. They used field glasses to make out an unmistakable disc shape with clear-cut edges.,,,,,
26174, 1943. More than one U.S. pilot, stating that engines stopped and that a “ray” from the UFO held them motionless in the air for a while. Then they were released and their engines started up again.,,,,,
26175, 1885. This report from the log of a British barque describes a “vast mass of fire” that plunged from the sky and narrowly missed the ship. But its actions,,,,,,

26186, 1944. On a flight from Britain to Singapore or Hong Kong,,,,,,
26187, the UFO-related disasters on the other side of the world are no less nu.merous than those on our side. Going back into history we find the following dis.appearances occurring even before the terms “flying saucer” or “UFO” were coined.,,,,,,
26188, William Brophy tried to fly solo from the Philippines to Shanghai.But somewhere in the China Sea,,,,,,
26189, she and her navigator disappeared. Strange “lights” were re.orted on the route the daring aviatrix followed.,,,,,,

26193, 1955. A ship on a scientific expedition, as in many Bermuda Triangle cases, no wreckage or bodies were ever found.,,,,
26194, a flock of UFOs flew over a convoy of U.S. war.ships and planes, of course, was before jets,,,,
26195, judging from the edict issued by the U.S. Navy on July 26,,,,,,
26196, no such order was given to Navy flyers-or Air Force pilots either-for the Atlantic. Is it possible that the Pacific with its Devil’s Triangle was deadlier than the Bermuda Triangle in the Atlantic?,,,,,,
26197,,,,,,,
26198, 1956. While chasing UFOs that were,,,,,,
26199, 200 miles south of Tokyo and just within the Devil’s· Triangle, with the loss of 41 lives.,,,,,
26200, 1954. The U.S. destroyer Marshall was escorting an aircraft carrier; they both steered across the Devil’s Deep on their way to Hong Kong. Suddenly,,,,,,

26202, scientists and military authorities have brushed aside UFO. as nonsense and have tried to find more orthodox explanations.,,,,,,

26206,,,,,,,
26207, while un.derneath the Bermuda Triangle lies At.lantis. Both Mu and Atlantis have been tied in with UFOs,,,,,,
26208, one theory claims that remnants of both civilizations still exist below the oceans, depending on the UFOiogist, those forces could b~ deliberately used to wreck ships and planes so that the crews might be captured.,,,,
26209, experiments aboard a scientific ship in 1954 gave indications that “peculiar magnetic forces coming from above have been detected in the Key West – Caribbean area” the Bermuda Triangle.,,,,,,
26210, just the opposite of the previous theory. What could that mean?,,,,,,
26211,,,,,,,
26212, it envisions galactic magnetic fields, such as the Bermuda and Devil’s Triangles. The result was the “hole in the sky” that could actually draw ships and planes out into space.,,,,,

26216, there are three “death triangles” in the Northern Hemisphere and three in the Southern. All of them are spaced at nearly equal distances from one another. Sanderson says they all have one feature in common that they are the “channels” where hot tropical waters collide with frigid Arctic or Antarctic waters.,,,,,,
26217, he believes the phenomena are pure.ly natural. That is, that account for the disappearances of ships and planes.,,,,,
26218, we do, to tie them in with the Bermuda and Devil’s Triangles. In the latter two areas, the incidence of UFOs is extraordinarily high.,,,,

Policy wonks south of the border will debate the pros and cons of the bill, which will see taxes go down for the vast majority of Americans. But from a Canadian standpoint, the new average American rate is just 26 per cent. Worse still, the general rate is unchanged. It has promised a national carbon tax in 2018, one study suggested that the average Canadian family was actually paying an additional $840 in taxes. With spending slated to jump a whopping 21 per cent by the end of the Trudeau government’s third year in power, this is cause for concern. Why invest in Canada and pay higher taxes when you can invest next door and pay less? This is especially true when competing for foreign investment.

President Trump regularly leans on American companies to invest more at home – a big problem for us considering American companies currently account for half of all FDI in Canada. Add a tax cut to that political pressure, and it could mean potentially big job losses as businesses head across the border and divert new investment stateside. Even setting aside foreign investment, taking a pass on investments at home in favour of better returns down south. Simply put, and start thinking of ways to keep Canadian tax levels competitive with our American counterparts. Originally Posted: CBC,,

27032,,,,,,,
27033,,,,,,,
27034, US public health authorities began recommending that all infants get the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine, instructing countries to vaccinate from birth even where hepatitis B virus was uncommon. Two 2018 studies (one in the US and one in India) take a closer look at the outcomes and implications of these blanket prescriptions. Although the studies focus on different aspects of their countries’ respective vaccine programs, both are cautionary tales,,,,
27035,,,,,,,
27036, the HepB vaccine in the US contained organic ethylmercury in the form of the preservative thimerosal—totaling 37.5 micrograms across the three doses. Regulators have never bothered to set any safety standards for ethylmercury,,,,,,
27037, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bragged in 2002 about having achieved a 90% national coverage rate in young children. However,,,,,,

27039, boys who received three doses of thimerosal-containing HepB vaccine were at a more than nine-fold significantly higher risk of receiving special education services compared to boys receiving no doses of HepB vaccine. Extrapolating to the US population as a whole, representing lifetime costs in excess of $1 trillion.,,,,,
27040,,,,,,,
27041, the WHO has strongly promoted universal HepB vaccination and particularly the initial birth dose. However, approximately three-fifths (61%) of women deliver at home rather than in a health facility, making it next to impossible for health providers to administer newborn vaccines. In recognition of these realities, meaning that many children still do not receive any HepB vaccine at all.,,,
27042,671). Three-fifths (59%) of the children had received at least three doses of HepB vaccine,,,,,,
27043, the investigators concluded that birth vaccination offered “no added protection”—lending support to the government’s “pragmatic” approach of waiting until six weeks to vaccinate babies born at home. What are the levels of protective antibodies in fully HepB-vaccinated children, they found that vaccine-induced protection waned rapidly and significantly, falling from 82% of under-one-year-olds to 47% of five-year-olds. Receiving a birth dose made no difference. What are the levels of protective antibodies in children who have not received any HepB vaccine? Finally,,,,

An exclusive wine tasting session and tour of the cellars at the Chateau de Beaune is followed by a gastronomic lunch in the orangery and a couple of hours to explore on our own the delightfully French town of Beaune. By Thursday we’re totally relaxed enjoying every moment of this barge cruise which today takes us to Gissey-sur-Ouche, again with plenty of opportunity to walk or cycle alongside. We cycle between two or three locks then head back onboard to relax on the sun deck with a glass of wine as we gently slide past sleepy villages and pretty lock houses. I make a mental note to ask Daniel how many locks we have now passed through but promptly forget as Carolyn’s busy topping up our glasses and bringing snacks. I estimate we’ve probably done about 20 or 30 locks and get back to watching the Burgundy world go by in the sunshine. After lunch we visit picturesque Clos de Vougeot, a family run winery built on the foundations of an old Cistercian abbey. There’s an opportunity to purchase many of the wines with shipping arranged to any destination in the world. That evening before dinner during one of his regular information updates Daniel announces we will be choosing our own lunch tomorrow in the produce market of Dijon. But for now its time for after dinner drinks and a soak in the spa pool. Friday and Joss joins us for the first part of our walking tour of Dijon. Here we visit the market and everyone gets a chance to choose what he or she would like to eat for lunch. Joss returns to the barge loaded up whilst we continue with some excellent shopping time including exploring the many mustard shops and the impressive Notre-Dame de Dijon. Returning to our barge and its time for our Dijon market extravaganza lunch – quiche lorraine, mussels, pate, raspberry gateau and pear and caramel alongside a fine Saint Romain white wine and a red Fleurie.

27282, Michigan — There is an old saying that those who don’t learn from the mistakes of others are destined to repeat them. Before Congress finalizes ill-conceived fuel economy standards that would almost double gasoline mileage by 2025, it could learn a lesson from a similar misguided experience 40 years ago. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter,,,,
27283, automakers crammed cars with unnecessarily complex fuel-saving technology, lighter cars were less safe. Now a new rule requiring a near-doubling of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards from 34.5 miles per gallon to 54.5 miles per gallon is up for final review. The rule was mandated by President Obama and adopted by Congress in 2015. Like Carter, Obama’s main goal was to reduce dependence on foreign oil. But oil imports as a share of products supplied have already been dropping dramatically due to America’s shale revolution,,,,
27284, most of the American oil industry is concentrated in the Gulf Coast region, we are still finding ways to tie up energy producers with expensive new government regulations. When Obama persuaded Congress to raise CAFE standards, he hoped to have a million electric cars on the road even though it’s becoming obvious that consumers prefer larger gasoline-burning vehicles. In a review last year assessing the progress of automakers towards the new CAFE standard, which will drive up car prices. There will be a shift to building cars with smaller engines because they are more fuel efficient and lighter. But Americans shouldn’t be forced to buy vehicles they don’t want. Everyone wants greater gas mileage. But the CAFE rule isn’t consistent with scientific and economic reality.,,,
27285, not more, safe SUVs and pickups, while others prefer light-weight more fuel efficient vehicles. Instead of using across-the-board government regulations, and some politicians still haven’t figured out that the path to greater energy independence is less, regulation. Competition among automakers for the next generation of fuel-efficient cars is a much better way to change the vehicle fleet of the future. The obvious answer is for Congress to retract the ill-conceived fuel-economy standard.,,

27513, short-term rates can rise to match, the banks and mortgage companies can’t earn more (or anything) from lending. They can quickly get into big financial trouble because they can’t finance their outstanding loan packages at a profitable rate.,,,,,

It seems that curves started to become fashionable in the ‘60s on the likes of the E-type Jaguar but many cars of that period were still boxy and this was the case right through to the ‘80s, one where manufacturers have gone back to the drawing board and created something that combines both straight lines and curves. The Fiat Tipo is a good example of this. The front wheel arches are a tasteful blend of slightly boxy curvaceousness which joins up with the equally well crafted bonnet. It looks chunkier from the side than head on. And it’s a good effect. This is offset by the two-tone 16-inch alloy wheels.,,,,,

Fiat, which is the world’s seventh largest car maker, is no surprise and helps this Italian cut a strong presence on the road. The boot is not so successful, although the seat fabric seems a little thin as I feel my young son’s foot in the base of my back. It feels a sporty car and the diesel unit - coupled to a six speed manual gearbox - can have a surprising sense of urgency, removing any irritating pollen. It’s very effective.,

28064, let’s discuss olive oil. Plenty of nutrients, and Vitamins E and K. Olive oil is packed with essential fatty acids, such as oleic (55-85% of the oil), without any trans fats (that clog the arteries),,,

28091, as people are literally dying in the corridors of hospitals because of Britain’s overrun socialized medicine scam. In case Venezuela didn’t do enough to prove that socialism is a deadly joke on humanity,,,,,,
28092, according to the BBC last week. More details continue to emerge surrounding the newest outrages which have sprung up from Britain’s crisis-beset healthcare system. This most recent revelation came as a result of an open letter sent to the Prime Minister by 68 senior doctors,,,,,,
28093, which collected statistics from NHS hospitals in England and Wales, with many of them eventually being put into makeshift wards hastily constructed in side-rooms. In addition, it was revealed that around 120 patients per day are being attended to in corridors and waiting rooms, in full view of other patients. “There was no dignity. It was degrading, there was nothing they could do. It was chaos.”,,
28094, over 97% of its trusts in England were reporting levels of overcrowding so severe as to be “unsafe.” For those who champion socialism, just as under socialism in general, poverty becomes the norm.,,,,
28095, the state-run healthcare system somehow magically become a utopia. Almost as predictable as the regular emergence of new stories of this kind is the equally unwavering refusal of British commentators to consider that the state-run monopoly structure of the system itself might be to blame. Many, to distract from the more fundamental flaws of the system. Officials from Public Health England went so far as to openly dismiss this as a major cause of the current healthcare crisis, stating that current levels of hospital admissions due to the flu are “certainly not unprecedented.” The aging population and local councils’ failure to provide more non-hospital care have also been blamed.,,,,
28096, the belief that Britain’s perpetual healthcare crisis is solely the result of funding cuts by miserly Conservative politicians is so widespread that it is almost never challenged,,,,,,
28097, even when adjusting for inflation, or so they say. However, to believe such a statement one would have to make two separate misinterpretations of the statistics, even when adjusting for inflation. Secondly,,,
